#Assignment 2 - Second Pi
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Fall 2017

##Overview

You are going to get your Raspberry Pi running with CentOS, and do one of the Pi
learning activities.

##Teams

Use the same team as for assignment 1.

##CentOS Setup

Install CentOS 7 on your Pi. 
See https://github.com/rharmonson/richtech/wiki/Using-CentOS-7.2.1511-Minimal-on-the-Raspberry-PI-3

##Pi Activity

Complete another of the **Activities** in the second
section on the [Pi learning page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/learn/).
This would be a different activity than you did for the previous assignment.

Choose one that suits your Pi accessories. You may have to install additional
software on your Pi as part of the activity.

##Submission

Build a simple word processed document which lists what is in your Pi build,
and which then has a picture showing your activity running.
The picture could be taken with your phone, if your Pi has a monitor & keyboard,
or it might be a screenshot of an SSH session from your laptop into your Pi.

You might need a second picture to confirm that your Pi is running CentOS.

###Disclaimer

If you submit a goofy selfie, of you & your Pi, you thereby grant me permission
to use that picture in whatever embarrassing context I can think of!
