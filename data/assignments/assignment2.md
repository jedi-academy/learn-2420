#Assignment 2 - Second Pi
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Winter 2018

#Don't Panic!

I am posting the assignment writeup early, so you have something you can
productively work on, the week that we miss seminar because of Family Day.

I expect this assignment to be completed on your own time - we won't be
taking a seminar period to work on it, unlike the first assignment.

I am setting the due date for the end of the month, so that you can work
on it when time permits, without impacting your midterm preparation.

There will be a midterm prep activity for week 7, posted as soon as practical.

##Overview

You are going to get your Raspberry Pi running with CentOS, and do another one of the Pi
learning activities.

##Teams

Use the same team as for assignment 1.

##Submission

Your word processed document, in any conventionally readable format (doc, docx,
odf, pdf, md).

Due: Feb 28th, 23:30.

No penalty or bonus for early submission - peace of mind is priceless.
Just don't forget about the assignment until the last minute!

##CentOS Setup

Install CentOS 7 on your Pi. 
See https://github.com/rharmonson/richtech/wiki/Using-CentOS-7.2.1511-Minimal-on-the-Raspberry-PI-3

Caution: make sure that you are getting a version of CentOS which has been compiled
for the ARM processor used in the Pi!

##Pi Activity

Complete another of the **Activities** in the second
section on the [Pi learning page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/learn/).
This would be a different activity than you did for the previous assignment.

The activity list has been pruned a bit, based on the first Pi lab.
Each team has its own activity below, and it should be different
from what you did last time.

Group numbers go up to 30. Treat the list as a wrap-around list if your group
number doesn't have an entry here. Group 27 would take activity 1, group 28
activity 2, and so on.

##Submission

Build a simple word processed document which tells the story of your

designated activity on it.

in your VM?

Be sure to include at least a couple of screenshots or pictures,
clearly showing CentOS on your Pi, as well as your activity
running.

###Disclaimer

If you submit a goofy selfie, of you & your Pi, you thereby grant me permission
to use that picture in whatever embarrassing context I can think of!
