#Augmented Reality Driver and Support in Linux
by Anonymous

Augmented reality driver has been around for decades, and constantly adapting to changing operating systems. Today, we see uses of AR technology in application development, gaming and integrated AR solution. Integration for all types of operating systems are important for the future of AR. There is multiple platform in developing libraries and tool kits

The first augmented reality technology was developed in 1968 at Harvard by a computer scientist Ivan Sutherland. The foundation of today’s AR technology is based on the original head-mounted display system. The early system imposed virtual information on a physical environment and was primarily used in military and industrial purposes. Support for Linux was released in 1999 by ARToolKit. It is currently the most used tracking library on Linux, it is an “open-source computer tracking library for creation of strong augmented reality applications” which simulate virtual reality on the real world. The stable release of the ARToolKit was launched on March 23, 2016 so it is still relatively new technology. ARToolKit implements lots of functionality such as “camera position/orientation tracking, tracking of black squares, tracking of planar images, and optical head-mounted display support”. Their goal is to have support and same fast performance on real time AR applications and work as plugins for Unity and OpenSceneGraph.

Newer technology such as the DAQRI smart helmet powered by an Ubuntu AR application is a Ubuntu powered augmented reality helmet. It is not targeted at gamers, but it is used mostly for industrial settings where it brings life to data by using thermal cameras to check for abnormalities. The helmet is powered by a 6th generation Intel Core m7 processor and they hope to ruggedized the helmet for industrial environments focused on developing “integrated RGB camera, stereo infrared camera with an infrared light projector” to infer depth and perception.

During the NASA Space App Challenge, Team AirOS won second place with an augmented realty headgear system that included a Linux-driven Intel Edison module hooked to an Oculus Rift. The popularity of the Oculus Rift has a tremendous impact on modern gaming and raised the bar on gaming developers. The team used sensor-enabled AR headset for ground technicians and astronauts. The startup received great praise and the technology can be incorporated with modern day technology. Team AirOS managed to embed the Linux system into the Unity 3D game engine that controls the Oculus Rift and enhanced the functions of the headset. The Linux application on the Intel Edison managed sensor input from the “Arduino breakout and Seed Studio’s Grove temperature and flame detectors”. This resulted in an advanced GUI overlay to the AR display with sensor updates. The team continues to develop, and we will see more of Linux integration with existing technologies.

The AR industry is still in its development phase, trying to find practical usage in entertainment, industrial and application sectors. There are many ideas out there and scientists are starting to build upon new creation. Developers will continue to develop for AR because of the endless possibilities it can bring to our future. 

Currently AR technology is shown with a headgear or some sort, being able to see a virtual reality is a main point of AR. These examples highlight the rapid advancements of this technology. While AR is at an early developmental phase, I believe we will see a lot more regarding augmented reality in the future.
