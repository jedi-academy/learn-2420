#Linux and Home automation
by Ammar

Home automation may sound like a science-fiction dream, but in reality is is not only commonplace, but relatively simple to get started, especially with Linux. Home Automation along with many other types of automation is a part of the Internet of Things(IOT).

The Internet of Things is an evolution of mobile, home, and embedded applications that are connected to the internet integrating greater computer capabilities using data analytics to extract meaningful information in order to improve automation in daily tasks. For example, internet security cameras where you can monitor your home at any given time from your smart phone.

Being able to control your household appliances starts at the low end with plug and play radio frequency and relays that connect to a home and are in charge of scheduling and monitoring. At the high end, home automation may include environmental controls, security systems, and many other add-ons. Lighting and environmental control are the common form of home automation. You can set it to a certain time of day, week, month year or even season, or you can have them respond to sensor data and ambient light or temperature. In addition, almost any appliance can be remote controlled and operated by a computer/smart phone. These sensors and chips could be placed in almost anything in your home, from cookie jars to fridges and stoves. Some fridges are able to notify you what is inside your fridge from the comfort of your phone. They will also tell you what you can make with the stuff that’s inside the fridge and what the perfect meal for you is based on your mood, activity level, or even your diet restrictions. How many times have you left the house wondering if you had turned off your stove? With advanced technology you are able to check if the stove was left on and turn it off wirelessly. You are also able to adjust the temperature of the stove if you have anything cooking on it. 

Most technological companies are now implementing the IOT technology into their products. How it works is these products are connected to a network and through that network everything is sent to a cloud which your device has access to and provides live updates. 

The purpose of the IOT is to transform our businesses, lives, and our world in countless ways. It allows us to rely on the technology more than we can rely on ourselves and makes everyday tasks easies with a simple use of an application. With this increase in automation comes a job threat to the jobs and a potential threat to our overall health and safety with the advances of artificial intelligence. This technology is being implemented in things we use every day, from our vehicles all the way to our coffee makers. It has the potential to increase safety, convenience, ease and efficiency in our lives by a large margin in the coming years. It could potentially save lives with instant reporting from devices that monitor our health. 

The process starts with the devices themselves which communicate with the IOT platform. This platform integrates data from many devices and applies analytics to share the most valuable data with applications that address industry specific needs. So in a home environment it will alert or if doors or windows are open, or if you forgot to lock your door. These are just a few of the many things that this technology is capable of doing.

The IOT could come with security problems. Though the IOT provides countless benefits there are also some potential security issues. For one, it gives companies more opportunities to invade privacy. For example, some companies have technology that can track you across multiple platforms and devices by embedding tiny sounds into websites or television programs that while inaudible to us can be detected by our devices and that data can be fed back to silver bush. According to a study by Hewlett Packard 70% of IOT enabled devices can potentially be hacked.

The IOT is a growing area and in the future it will take over most of our daily tasks and will develop into a world operated by robots. The latest version of Internet Protocol IPV6, creates more potential addresses than there are atoms on the surface of the Earth. So in the coming future we will be living in a world with data reacting to us changing every moment depending on your needs. This is altering reality as time goes by, and it’s all regulated by the IOT. It is estimated that by 2020 there will be more smart devices than humans on the Earth.
