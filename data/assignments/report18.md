#Linux and the internet of thing (IoT)
by Alexander

##What is the Internet of things?

The internet of things is a term that was made by Kevin Ashton in 1999 and is used to describe the network of physical devices such as vehicles, home appliances and many other items using electronics and software to collect and exchange data.

The basis of using these devices is to increase efficiency, receive more accurate data and reduce costs. It also reduces the amount of required work a human has to do in order to do tasks.

##Who is responsible for the Internet of things?

the internet of things is a broad area which has many different people working independently on many projects, which within these projects there are several different companies also working on them. 

An example application would be Automotive-grade Linux, this is being worked on by many well known car companies such as Mazda, Suzuki, Toyota and many others but also but well known tech companies such as Intel and Nvidia. The idea is to make a standard for automotive IoT for anything from self driving cars to streaming video onto screens anything that has to do with IoT and cars.

##What do they want to achieve?

The goals for IoT vary a lot, its less of a single goal and more of a I made this goal and what I am doing to achieve it is considered a part of IoT, using the above example they want to make self driving cars but it can also be used for something such as making street lamps change there brightness depending on weather to increase power efficiency.

##Where does IoT stand?

IoT has been around for a while and is being applied constantly and adapting with expanding technology with the increased capabilities of technology the ability to create new IoT projects expands as well. IoT can be applied by anyone from high end companies to people who want to make something in their spare time there is very little limit to what it accomplishable.

##How to use IoT?

To get started there are devices you can buy such as a raspberry pi which you can connect and use to host Linux and the software to create a way of applying what you create. There are several programming languages used, among the most popular are C, Java and Python so you can pick what is most comfortable to you or certain Linux operating systems have different languages that are supported so it can also depend on which OS you plan on using.

Other than getting started with the hardware/software the main thing you need is an idea of what you want to make. Since this subject is incredibly broad there are many different projects you can decide upon and create.
