#Linux Scanner Support
by Quang Binh

Paperless is a handy lifestyle to save and secure documents. Window users have drivers and software’s which are provided by the manufactures to support their customers operating the scanners. Unfortunately, most scanner makers don’t have software or driver for the Linux. However, there are some good applications available for Linux users, and they work very well. One of them is SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) which is an application programming interface(API) provides standardizes access to many scanner hardware.

SANE was created by David Mosbergger and Tang Andy Beck, released on November 27, 1996. One of the most benefit from SANE is allow one driver per image acquisition. For instance, instead of programming 9 drivers for 3 devices and 3 applications, we just need to build 6 programs. The more devices we have, the more we save on developments time and code duplication.

The API supports command-line driver interfaces or network-transparent scanning which is very convenient for alone computer or a network. 

Initially, Sane was meant for UNIX environment. However, the standard of SANE was designed carefully to create a potential path to the different operation systems such as Windows and MAC. SANE is the hope which will easily implemented for many hardware’s like digital cameras, and virtual devices like file filters.

SANE is represent as clear as its name, create an easy access for the scanner. The original reason was a support API for Linux user to use scanners. Development of SANE also generates a path to the diversity of the API for many devices and operation systems. SANE shows us that Linux is an open source operation system, but it can provide appropriate software and services for multipurpose for different users.

The usage of SANE is simple and easy, with XSane is a front-end application for all users, with a variety of functions. GUI shows all the available options, and the panel presents the result. Some users like old fashion with fast response command-line will also have their taste with scanadf which is an automatic documents feeder function.

XSane is available at http://www.sane-project.org/ , the website covers all the material of the application, from document and bug reports to update user with all the information they need. The application may not be well known for most people; however, Linux users evaluate XSane as their powerful tool. XSane brings an excellent experience for beginners by its friendly GUI, they can explore the app by themselves; reading documents from the application itself also provide useful information about the all available functions.
