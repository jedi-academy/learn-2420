#Assignment 1 - Vanilla Pi

##Overview

learning activities, assigned by team below.

##Teams

This can be done as a pair, or individually. Either way, sign up for one of the "Pi team" groups
on D2L.

Each "team" will need their own Raspberry Pi kit.
It can be as simple as the basic starter kit, or you are
welcome to get one of the more elaborate ones, with additional
accessories.

##Pi Setup

to use that picture in whatever embarrassing context I can think of!
