#Assignment 1 - First Pi
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Fall 2017

##Overview

You are going to get your Raspberry Pi running, and do one of the Pi
learning activities.

##Teams

This can be done as a pair, or individually. Either way, sign up for one of the "Pi team" groups
on D2L.

Each "team" will need their own Raspberry Pi kit.
It can be as simple as the basic starter kit, or you are
welcome to get one of the more elaborate ones, with additional
accessories.

##Pi Setup

Assemble or cobble together your Pi, with Raspbian OS installed on it.

##Pi Activity

Complete one of the **Activities** in the second
section on the [Pi learning page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/learn/).

Choose one that suits your Pi accessories. You may have to install additional
software on your Pi as part of the activity.

##Submission

Build a simple word processed document which lists what is in your Pi build,
and which then has a picture showing your activity running.
The picture could be taken with your phone, if your Pi has a monitor & keyboard,
or it might be a screenshot of an SSH session from your laptop into your Pi.

###Disclaimer

If you submit a goofy selfie, of you & your Pi, you thereby grant me permission
to use that picture in whatever embarrassing context I can think of!
