# Assignment 1 - Vanilla Pi
ACIT2420 - BCIT - Winter 2019

## Overview

You are going to get your Raspberry Pi running, and do one of the Pi
learning activities described below.

## Teams

This can be done as a pair, or individually. Either way, sign up for one of 
the set-appropriate "Pi team" groups on D2L.

Each "team" will need their own Raspberry Pi kit.
It can be as simple as the basic starter kit, or you are
welcome to get one of the more elaborate ones, with additional
accessories.

You will probably find a network cable handy, whether to plug your Pi into
one of the network drops, or to add it to your PC's network.
If you have an HDMI cable, you can take advantage of one of the pod monitors.
A bluetooth keyboard could come in handy too. 

## Pi Setup

Assemble or cobble together your Pi, with Raspbian OS installed on it.
That should be the deafult.

## Pi Activity

The [Pi "creator" projects page](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?curriculum%5B%5D=%201).
has a number of introductory activities for the Pi. I have selected six for you to choose from, shown
below. Pick one of them to do, and enhance the activity in some way.

We have two Javascript projects:

- [Talk like a Pirate](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/talk-like-a-pirate) ...
webpage using jQuery to translate mere mortal speech into proper pirate talk
- [Zombie apocalypse survival map](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/zombie-apocalypse-map) ... 
making a webpage, with CSS & Javascript; uses a GoogleMaps API key, hmmm

... and two Python ones:

- [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rock-paper-scissors) ... 
a Python program to play the classic game against the computer
- [Shakespearean insult generator](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/shakespearean-insult-generator) ...
python program to show random ages-old insults that you save in a CSV file

... and two built with the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) visual programming tool:

- [Boat Race](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/boat-race) ...
a racing game in which the player uses the mouse to navigate a boat to an island without bumping into obstacles.
- [Scratch Cat Goes Skiing](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/scratch-cat-goes-skiing) ...
a skiing game in which you have to avoid randomly appearing obstacles to score points.

These are all pretty basic projects, and I would choose the one you think
will be the most fun or the most different to your background.

## Submission

Build a simple word processed document with:

- a description of your Pi build, specifically which kit you started with and which
accessories (if any) you added
- one or more pictures of your Pi running Raspbian OS
- a brief report on doing your activity
- one or more screenshots or images of your completed activity running

Basically, tell the story of your Pi  experience.
Images need to be good enough resolution that the reader can tell they
came from a Pi. Screenshots would be lovely, but problematic.

Submit your document to the assignment 1 dropbox, by Sunday Feb 10, 17:30.

## Grading

A rubric has been attached to the assignment dropbox.
It has three categories, each graded on a scale of 1 to 5.

Full marks for  
- Build: clearly described build description with legible images
- Completion: clear description of the activity & challenges along the way
- Success: clear description of how you went above & beyond the base activity

###Disclaimer

If you submit a goofy selfie, of you & your Pi, you thereby grant me permission
to use that picture in whatever embarrassing context I can think of!
