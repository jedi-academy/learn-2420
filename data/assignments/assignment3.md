# Assignment 3 - Third Pi
ACIT2420 - BCIT - Winter 2019


## Overview

You are going to harden your Pi and test its defenses.

Your Pi with CentOS is a great starting point ... you started out
with a minimal installation, and then might have corrupted it with additional
services and packages to do your Pi activity for the last
assignment.

## Teams

Use the same team as for assignment 2, unless otherwise arranged.

## Background

Your Pi has CentOS installed, with keypair access

You will need a guest/visitor user account, and they are to have SSH access.
You need to share this access information with any attacking team.

### Job 1 - Assessment

Install & run the OpenSCAP tools, on your Pi server, and see what it thinks of your configuration.

Include the report summaries or a reasonable excerpt.

Suggestion: the OpenSCAP security guide would be an interesting read.

The biggest challenge will be determining the appropriate set of tests
to run. Remember that your CentOS is a 32-bit version.

## Job 2 - Hardening

"Harden" your CentOS-equipped Pi.

We are not looking for a shopping list, or for simply running
OpenSCAP with remediation enabled (which could be one thing you did).

Target a half-dozen productive things to harden your Pi.
If you want to do more, that is fine, within reason.

Hint: use the "recipes", Luke.

Describe the steps taken. Include any relevant or interesting terminal excerpts.

## Job 3 - Penetration Test

Attempt to find a way through another team's hardened Pi's defenses,
in 20 minutes or less.

Target a half-dozen "exploits". More is fine, but don't get carried away.

Hint: use the "recipes", Luke.

Describe the steps taken. Include any relevant or interesting terminal excerpts.

This should not consume days of your time!

Note: social engineering (eg donut bribe) is not an acceptable "exploit".

## Submission

Build a word processed document explaining what you did
for each of the above. Include URLs for guidance or tools used.

Provide appropriate screenshots.

If appropriate, submit shell script(s) for the above.

Audience: (1) us, (2) you, for when you have to do this on the job.

Due: **19:30 Apr 11, 2019**

Note that final exams start on Fri the 12th. We encourage you to complete &
submit this assignment for Weds the 10th.

##Grading

The assignment dropbox will have a rubric, to guide you.

Our primary interest is the clarity and quality of your writeup, not its
length or whether you succeeded in defending your Pi or breaching another's.
