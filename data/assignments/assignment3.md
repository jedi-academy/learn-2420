#Assignment 3 - Third Pi  D R A F T
ACIT2420 - BCIT - Fall 2018

CAUTION: This is only a draft, and needs to be coordinated
with ACIT2515!!!

##Overview

You are going to harden your Pi and test its defenses.

Your Pi with CentOS is a great starting point ... you started out
with a minimal installation, and then might have corrupted it with additional
services and packages to do your Pi activity for the last
assignment.

##Teams

Use the same team as for assignments 1 & 2, unless otherwise arranged.

##Background

Your Pi has a service running on port 5000, per the last assignment.
You also have secure SSH setup, with no remote root access
and with keypairs needed to login, right?

You will need a guest/visitor user account, and they are to have SSH access.


###Job 1 - Assessment - NOT

You did this last week.

##Job 2 - Hardening

"Harden" your CentOS-equipped Pi.

We are not looking for a shopping list, or for simply running
OpenSCAP with remediation enabled (which would be one thing you did).

Target a half-dozen productive things to harden your Pi.
If you want to do more, that is fine, within reason.

Hint: use the "recipes", Luke.

Describe the steps taken. Include any relevant or interesting terminal excerpts.

##Job 3 - Penetration Test

Attempt to find a way through your hardened Pi's defenses. 

Target a half-dozen "exploits". More is fine, but don't get carried away.

Hint: use the "recipes", Luke.

Describe the steps taken. Include any relevant or interesting terminal excerpts.

This should not consume days of your time!

##Job 4 - Attack Another Team

With the agreement of another team, try to penetrate their Pi.
They shall provide its IP address, and the user name & password
they setup for guests.

Your attack should be completed within 15 minutes, successful or not.
The CSI(T)-Cyber team is alerted the minute you start, and they will
be pounding down your door 15 minutes from then.

Hint: use the "recipes", Luke.

Describe your attack & the result, identifying the other team.

Feel free to target more than one team, for fun (not marks).

##Submission

Build a word processed document explaining what you did
for each of the above. Include URLs for guidance or tools used.

Provide appropriate screenshots.

If appropriate, submit shell script(s) for the above.

Audience: (1) me, (2) you, when you have to do this on the job.

Due: 19:30 Dec 2, 2018? This needs to be coordinated with ACIT2515

##Grading

The assignment dropbox will have a rubric, to guide you.

My primary interest is the clarity and quality of your writeup, not its
length or whether you succeeded in defending your Pi or breaching another's.
