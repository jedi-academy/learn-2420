#Assignment 3 - Third Pi
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Fall 2017

##Overview

You are going to harden your Pi and test its defenses.

##Teams

Use the same team as for assignments 1 & 2.

##Hardening

"Harden" your CentOS-equipped Pi.

If a team of two, one of you will have prime responsibility for this.
If a team of one, expect another team to assault your hardened Pi.

##Cracking

Attempt to find a way through your hardened Pi's defenses. 

If a team of two, the second team member will be responsible for this.
If a team of one, assault another team's hardened Pi.

##Submission

Build a simple word processed document which shows two lists:

- what you did to harden your CentOS-equipped Pi
= what you did to try to break through the defenses

Provide pictorial evidence of the above.

Feel free to comment on the above, as advice to offer anyone
thinking of doing this.

###Disclaimer

If you submit a goofy selfie, of you & your Pi, you thereby grant me permission
to use that picture in whatever embarrassing context I can think of!
