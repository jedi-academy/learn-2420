Linux In space

## What is it?
As the title suggests, this report will cover the use of Linux in outer space. 
In recent history, Elon Musk's SpaceX has made liberal use of Linux for "redundant flight computers", which are used to control the Merlin engines of their Falcon 9 rockets. [(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) 18 of 19 flights were successful in their mission. 
Linux was also used for communication with NASA's Curiosity rover on mars (and the rover is controlled by a custom operating system known as VxWorks). Curiosty continues to explore mars today, totalling "5 years and 80 days (as of october 25, 2017)". [(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Mars_Science_Laboratory)
For this report, I will be covering the switch from Windows to Linux on the International Space Station (ISS) for their mission critical systems. 

## Who is behind it?
The United Space Alliance, a group responsible for managing the computers aboard the ISS made the decision to switch from Windows to Linux. The change was made as they were looking for "an operating system that was stable and reliable". [(3)](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/155392-international-space-station-switches-from-windows-to-linux-for-improved-reliability)
Specifically, Debian 6 will be used for this switch. 

## What do they hope to achieve?
Other than being much more stable and reliable, these converted Linux machines will "join many other systems aboard the ISS that already run various flavors of Linux". [(3)](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/155392-international-space-station-switches-from-windows-to-linux-for-improved-reliability) After this switch, there should be no computers on the space station that runs a Windows operating system. 
The use of linux for all computers will also allow for in-house control, which would allow for patching and adjusting on demand. 
Finally, the use of Linux will "immunize the ISS against future infections" against malware, as there has perviously been a case of the W32.Gammima.AG worm infecting onboard computers [(4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W32.Gammima.AG)

## Where does it stand?
The conversion to Linux underwent in early 2013, and the ISS continues to use linux as their main operating system. 
As for future space faring projects, they will more than likely ditch windows for linux due to its reliability, and open endedness. 

## How to play with the tech? 
To get hired for NASA one would probably need to complete education in one (but probably more) of the following fields: 

* Aeronautical Engineering
* Geophysics
* Aeronautics	 	
* Industrial Engineering
* Aerospace Engineering	 	
* Materials Engineering
* Astronautical Engineering	 
* Materials Science
* Astronautics	 
* Mathematics, Applied or Pure
* Astronomy	 
* Mechanics, Applied or Engineering
* Astrophysics	 
* Mechanical Engineering
* Biomedical Engineering	
* Metallurgical Engineering
* Ceramic Engineering	 
* Metallurgy
* Ceramics	 	
* Meteorology
* Chemical Engineering	 	
* Nuclear Engineering
* Chemistry	
* Nuclear Engineering Physics
* Civil Engineering	 
* Oceanography
* Computer Engineering	
* Optical Engineering
* Computer Science*	 
* Physics
* Earth and Planetary Science	 
* Physics, Applied or Engineering
* Electrical Engineering	 
* Space Science
* Electronics Engineering	 
* Structural Engineering
* Geology	 	
* Welding Engineering

And even then, many of these careers won't allow you to interact with the use of Linux (in space).
Immediate use of Linux in space would be next to impossible, and would require years of dedication and study.
