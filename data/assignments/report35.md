# Animation in Linux
by Rodney

Animation is the art of taking a series of still images - each slightly different from each other - and presenting them rapidly, one after another, so that the illusion of motion is formed. The effect is essentially an optical illusion created by out brains being unable to distingiush the individual frames, once the frame rate is sufficiently high. You would think that most animations are created and edited on machines with Windows and OSX due to convenience, but you would be wrong. Linux has some distinct advantages when it comes to animating when it is deployed at scale and in a pipeline vs traditional desktop operating systems. It is because of these flexibilities that has made it the prime operating system choice for Hollywood animations and special effects department.

## Who supports it

The first major film produced on Linux servers was the 1997's Titanic. SInce then, Linux has become the favorite for many major studios. Some major studios who use Linux in their video animations include DreamWorks Animation, Pixar, Weta Digital and Industrial Light and Magic. Weta Digital is known for their work in the Lord of the Rings series while Industrial Light and Magic is known for Star Wars (the original trilogy). Just knowing that Linux played a role in major films already shows how much support Linux has.

## What do they hope to achieve

There are many reasons why people use Linux for their animation needs and many more for why studios continue to use Linux. The most basic reason for using Linux is that most digital animation studios used Unix workstations and servers until the mid 1990s. While Unix products were very powerful (at the time), they were also very expensive. As Linux matured, it became cheaper for studios to transfer over to Linux for a fraction of the cost that they were paying for Unix and it was also very easy to migrate their rendering software ad workflows. Linux also provided more customizable settings and the ability to easily automate the maintenance that was required for deployment and updates. Essentially, the main reason why companies switched over to Linux were because of costs, but with the added benefits that Linux provided, it was no contest.

## Where do they stand?

Animation is big in todays industries, whether you're using it to make film or you just want to animate some random video for the internet. All operating systems have software that support the use of Linux and you can run basically everything on any OS. However, if you were a big HollyWood studio and you had to choose which OS to use, the majority of answers would be Linux. As stated above, Linux was the cheapest option for most companies and the softwares provided, plus the integration between Unix and Linux was very easy, made Linux the number one choice for most companies. It became a no brainer to choose between a system that you already knew how to use and could easily integrate and another that would have required months to reformat your systems just to migrate.
