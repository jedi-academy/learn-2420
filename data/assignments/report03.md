#Country Flavoured Linux
by Mark

##Topic Defined
In our current era of increasing globalization, the world is moving towards sameness, in terms of computer systems the majority of countries in the world will use operating systems created by foreign countries rather then develop their own. However, some countries have opted to create their own operating systems for various reasons such as local language support or increased cyber security. This investigative report looks into what kinds of operating systems other countries around the world have created from using a Linux operating system as a base to create what could be considered as a ‘National Operating System’.

##China
In China a Linux based operating system (OS) called Kylin Linux was developed from Ubuntu Linux by a Chinese development team alongside various other Linux developers from all around the world. It should not be surprising really that China has developed its own version of Linux considering that China also has its own versions of almost all popular webservices (51.com = Facebook, Weibo = Twitter, Baidu = Google, etc..). The main feature of China’s Kylin Linux OS is that has extensive support for the Chinese language (Mandarin). In addition it also contains all the basic features of Ubuntu Linux, as well as its own unique desktop environment along with several default applications. Kylin Linux is very suitable for users who are familiar with Microsoft windows, as the desktop layout and default apps such as WPS Office are very similar to Moorcroft’s. The Chinese version of Linux under its full name Ubuntu Kylin Linux is open source and free to download on the Chinese website for Kylin Linux. In 2013 China fully released Ubuntu Kylin Linux 13.04 and since then its usership has grown across the country.

##Cuba
In Cuba through a state sponsored project at the Havana University of Information Science in 2009 a Cuban development team also created their own version of a Linux OS based on, initially Gentoo Linux then on, Ubuntu Linux. The Cubans called their Linux OS Nova. The main reason for Nova’s creation is debated. Some say it was created to be a lightweight OS in order to replace Windows XP on computers in Cuba that were using older hardware, which presumable cannot handle the excessive amount of code in a Windows OS. Others say that it was created as an attempt by the Cuban government to replace Windows on all computers because Windows was an American company and relations were strained between Cuba and America because of the American embargo against Cuba which then made it hard for anyone to update Microsoft Windows. Nova uses LXDE as its desktop environment and had its own version of Office to replace Microsoft Office. The Cuban Linux was open sourced and free for all Cubans. The last release of Nova Linux in Cuba was called Nova 2015, which was unsurprisingly released in 2015, however in 2016 Nova was discontinued by the Cuban government, possibly because the American embargo was over.


##North Korea
The North Korean government has been developing its own version of Linux called Red Star OS since 2002. There was very little information available about Red Star OS until information about it was leaked by a Russian student in North Korea. Then in 2014 Red Star OS 3.0 was leaked onto the internet. From what analysts of the OS have discovered Red Star OS has a Firefox-based browser called Naenara, an email client, media players, a music composition program, games, and a text editor. However, files are watermarked and file transfers are monitored and recorded. Also the user cannot change the OS as it is encrypted and if you try doing things such as turning off the firewall the Red Star OS will either give you an error or restart your computer. The reasons behind Red Star OS seem to be pretty clear, that the North Korean Government created it for monitoring its local population and preventing foreign content from coming into the country. Unless you get a leaked version of the OS the North Korean Red Star Linux is only available in North Korea. The North Koreans released their Red Star OS 3.0 in 2013 and have since released a 4.0 version as well, but very little information is available regarding Red Star OS 4.0. 

##India
In India the Indian government has created their own OS based on Linux called BOSS (Bharat Operating System Solutions). BOSS OS is a Debian based Linux OS, which was developed by  C-DAC, which is a Indian government owned organization created for advanced computing development. BOSS OS was created initially because the Indian government wanted its various governmental organizations to use BOSS OS primarily to reduce their reliance on Microsoft. BOSS OS is open sourced and free to download, and it also has support for most of all the Indian languages. BOSS OS is being used increasingly throughout India and has been substantially upgraded over the years, receiving significant upgrades to the OS and their online presence through their website. The latest version of BOSS OS was 6.0 and it was released in August 2015.
