#Embedded Linux
by Erguang

##Introduction

The article is the introduction of Linux on embedded system, which mostly is devices excluding desktop and laptop. 

These are some examples of devices that using Linux: smart TV, video recorders, network equipment, navigation equipment, medical instruments.

##Features
- Embedded systems are application specific & single functioned, the programs are executed repeatedly.
- Embedded systems are optimized for energy, code size, execution time, weight & dimensions, and cost.  
- Embedded systems are typically designed to meet real time constraints; a real-time system reacts to stimuli from the controlled object/ operator within the time interval dictated by the environment. For real time systems, right answers arriving too late (or even too early) are wrong.  
- Embedded systems often interact (sense, manipulate & communicate) with external world through sensors and actuators and hence are typically reactive systems; a reactive system is in continual interaction with the environment and executes at a pace determined by that environment.  
- They generally have minimal or no user interface.Â 

##Why Linux
Here are some advantages of using Linux in portable devices:
- Free sources are available.
- Various device drivers 
- Portable
- Network and file system support 
- Memory management. 

##Disadvantages
Here are some disadvantages of using Linux in devices:
- Linux is complex, it need time to boot.
- Compiling, porting the kernel can ban be challenge.

##Conclusion 
Due to some advantages of the Linux operating system, Linux is used on a great number of devices. For the ease of use on the device, the Linux would be configurated to perform a single of a few functions.
