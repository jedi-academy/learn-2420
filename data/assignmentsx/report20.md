#Linux and Identity & trust models
by Tommy

The identity of linux developer within a corporation and the relationship with other developers and system admins. Inline with the relationship is the trust models that each system admin and developer follows. The trust model can vary between three different models the information is determined valid and maintains information integrity.

**Who is behind it?**

Linux is the operating system widely used around the world so, with that in mind many corporations and or companies will use linux for the means of storing data or the technology they will use. Knowing this many corporations invested and helped linux become what it is today. The corporations may be the reason for the rapid growth of linux but the kernel developers follow a undisclosed rule. Even though they are hired and working for a company or corporations they all contribute to the linux code. It’s all about the code. They will work with other developers from a different corporation despite they are competitors in the same market. 

The corporations do play a part with the growth of linux but the individuals are the ones behind the linux identity. 

The trust model is between everyone and those who want to securely and keep the integrity of the data the is being sent across the internet and or local networks. The trust model is controlled by the certificate authority (CA), an entity that determines who can be trust and those who cannot. The CA is created by a user or by a trusted security corporation. The trust models include Direct trust, Hierarchical trust and the Web of trust.

**What do they hope to achieve?**

The system admins and developers hope to achieve working and secure code that improves the current linux kernel. The changes include improved security, bug fixes, new technologies and etc.The corporations hope to achieve better and more system admins. So far most of the current kernel developers are senior developers. The trust model is the achieves data integrity. 

**Standing**

Some corporations are hiring junior kernel developers to train them to potential make them able to contribute to the kernel team but those corporations have the resources to do so. Other corporations opt to hire existing or trusted developers.

The trust model as it stands is used widely around the world. The current model adopted by everyone is the web of trust. The web of trust involves the use of CA’s, the internet, keys, hashes and encryption. 

**Tech **  

The technology that is used for the trust models are pgp and gpg keys. The keys can be generated within the terminal. The command used to create a gpg key would be [gpg --gen-key]. On completion you will end with a public and private key. The keys are used to identify one’s self and verify the data sent. When using the keys they have a trust level and validity level. The levels are fully trust/valid, marginal trust/valid and no trust/invalid.
