#Open source licensing for Linux
by Sweeha

Licensing is granting specific permissions for others to use that work while holding the original copyright on that work. Open source licensing refers to the fewer restrictions imposed on using a particular software. UNIX was developed by AT&T Bell Laboratories and during 1960’s and 1970’s it held the dominant market position. US Justice Department issued a consent decree barring AT&T from engaging in commercial activities outside telephone services. It was then when AT&T Bell Labs gave UNIX source code form under terms that allowed modification and redistribution.
An open source license is a recent trend that began in 1990's allowing software to be freely used, modified and shared. The Open source helps in modifying and transforming the code overtime. It does not promote ownership and establishes a cooperative work environment where all individuals are working to improve open source technology. 

##GNU General Public License (GPL)
GPL is a free software license that guarantees rights on open software projects. It allows legally copying, distributing and modifying the software. GNU was first launched in September 1983 by Richard Stallman from Free Software Foundation (FSF). Linux Kernel is one of the licensed programs under GPL. GPL ensures the software remains free to use for all the contributors. 
Free software refers to the ‘Freedom’ and not the price. GNU encourages people who redistribute free software to charge as much as an individual can in the marketplace. It can range from nothing to a dollar or maybe a billion dollars. The charges imply only on executable form of the software and not on its source code. People are granted these as “Customer Rights” or “Fair Business” outside the scope of the software license. Any person can choose to stop distributing the source code, but if somebody got it from the same person then they have the right to continue distribution of the source without the person’s permission. 
With GPL:
You can distribute the software however you want. 
You can copy the software
You can charge a fee to distribute the software.
You can modify the software accordingly.

##Massachusetts Institute of Technology License (MIT)
MIT License is the shortest and broadest of all open source licenses. In terms it defines that every person gives the right to anyone to do anything with one’s software code as long as they attribute the original work back to the original source. When using this type of license you must include a copy of it within the root of source code or as a text file and mention the create year and full name of the creators.  
With MIT:
-You can use, copy or modify the software however you want. 
-You have no restrictions on its distributing techniques. You may or may not charge for the software.
-You have a restriction accompanied by the license agreement.

Open source software today has a strong presence in industry and government. Organizations are saving millions of dollars on IT by using open source software.
