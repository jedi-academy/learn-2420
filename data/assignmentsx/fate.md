The clear preference is to work with Raspberry Pis, specifically getting CentOS 7
running on one.

So ...

Signup for a one or two person group, in  "Pi teams".

##Buy a Pi

Between you, purchase a Raspberry Pi 3 B kit, choosing the one that you feel would
be the most fun to play with after the course (eg media centre, ultimate kit, basic kit).

If you want to keep the microSD card that comes with your kit separate, for instance with
Raspbian or NOOBS installed, then get a second microSD card to use with CentOS - probably 8 or 16 GB.

You may want to provide for some form of input, for instance a keyboard.  
You may want to provide for some form of output, eg an HDMI cabel
to an external monitor, or a small touch monitor specifically for the Pi.  
Whether you choose wifi is up to you.

If you don't have a keyboard and display, then you are probably going to have to SSH
into the Pi. It looks like it uses DHCP, so you may have to hunt for its IP address.

Some of you may have a Pi already, which is fine. There are other kits available too, but more expensive.

If a team of two, you can fight over who gets to keep it, or sell it and split the proceeds.
