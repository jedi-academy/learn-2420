#Assignment 1 - Vanilla Pi
ACIT2420 - BCIT - Fall 2018

##Overview

You are going to get your Raspberry Pi running, and do one of the Pi
learning activities described below.

##Teams

This can be done as a pair, or individually. Either way, sign up for one of the "Pi team" groups on D2L.

Each "team" will need their own Raspberry Pi kit.
It can be as simple as the basic starter kit, or you are
welcome to get one of the more elaborate ones, with additional
accessories.

You will probably find a network cable handy, whether to plug your Pi into
one of the network drops, or to add it to your PC's network.
If you have an HDMI cable, you can take advantage of one of the pod monitors.
A bluetooth keyboard could come in handy too. 

##Food for Thought

A little birdie has whispered in my ear that the second
and third assignments in 2420 and 2515 will be on your Pi: setting up CentOS
on it for 2420, and building a Python API/service on it for 2515.

Another little birdie was heard thinking out loud about the possibility that the Pi could
make a great platform for some of the 2620 exercises, especially since you
already have one. That would involve you getting a separate memory card.

Don't let your math teacher see 
[this blog page](https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-r-statistics-on-your-raspberry-pi/)!

##Pi Setup

Assemble or cobble together your Pi, with Raspbian OS installed on it.
That should be the deafult.

##Pi Activity

The [Pi learning page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/learn/).
has a number of **Activities** in the lower half of the webpage.
Each team should choose one of them.

 

###Group & Activity

- [Zombie apocalypse survival map](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/zombie-apocalypse-map) ... 
making a webpage, with CSS & Javascript; uses a GoogleMaps API key, hmmm
- [Shakespearean insult generator](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/shakespearean-insult-generator) ...
python program to show random ages-old insults that you save in a CSV file
- [Talk like a Pirate](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/talk-like-a-pirate) ...
webpage using jQuery to translate mere mortal speech into proper pirate talk
- [Turtle snowflakes](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/turtle-snowflakes) ... draw snowflakes in python
- [Gravity Simulator](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/gravity-simulator) ...
animated on-screen sprites, built using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) visual programming tool
- [Weightlessness Space Game](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/weightlessness) ...
a world-class (?) game, also built using Scratch

Two python activities, two javascript, and two Scratch activities to choose from ... your call :)


##Submission

Build a simple word processed document with:

- a description of your Pi build, specifically which kit you started with and which
accessories (if any) you added
- one or more pictures of your Pi running Raspbian OS
- a brief report on doing your activity
- one or more screenshots or images of your completed activity running

Basically, tell the story of your Pi  experience.
Images need to be good enough resolution that the reader can tell they
came from a Pi. Screenshots would be lovely, but problematic.

Submit your document to the assignment 1 dropbox, by Sunday Oct 7, 17:30.

##Grading

A rubric has been attached to the assignment dropbox.
It has three categories, each graded on a scale of 1 to 5.

Full marks for  
- Build: clearly described build description with legible images
- Completion: clear description of the activity & challenges along the way
- Success: clear description of how you went above & beyond the base activity

###Disclaimer

If you submit a goofy selfie, of you & your Pi, you thereby grant me permission
to use that picture in whatever embarrassing context I can think of!
