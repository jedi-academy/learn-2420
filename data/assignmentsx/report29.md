#Linux on Supercomputers
by Dickson

**Supercomputers**, for those unfamiliar, is a computer (like the name implies) that operates at a much higher level of computing power compared to a general desktop PC or laptop. The method of which a supercomputer is rated by is the amount of floating point operations per second it can process, or FLOPS for short.

For the past years Linux has dominated the supercomputer’s choice of operating system and continues to grow every year. It currently sits at 99.6% of the top 500 fastest supercomputers and is expected to reach 100% in the near future.

_China’s Sunway Tai Hu Light operates at a record holding 93 Petaflops, not teraflops, PETAflops.
Thats 93 **quadrillion** floating point operations per second._

If you were curious, the Sunwai Tai Hu Light is the equivalent of **930,000** Intel 5820 (6 core) CPUs, or the power of **61,380,000** iPad Pros. How’s that i7 now?


##So why do (almost) all the fastest supercomputers in the world use linux? Including the fastest supercomputer in the world, China’s _Sunway Tai Hu Light_. 

It really boils down to one word, **efficiency**. There is currently no other operating system that offers the level of scalability and reliability Linux does. Many of, if not all, of these supercomputers are used to compute specific tasks such as business intel, artificial intelligence, decision based applications to name a few. As such, consumer oriented operating systems are bloated with too much unnecessary processes and were not designed with 100% efficiency in mind.   

##Who makes/uses these supercomputers?

A large assortment of companie are responsible for these supercomputers, more well known names are ones like;
-IBM
-Fujitsu Tech
-Dell
-Amazon
-Oracle

##What’s the deal with these supercomputers and the linux OS? Why do they even exist?

The easy answer would be to say it’s just a test to see what us as humanity are currently capable of achieving technologically speaking. However all these supercomputers (yes even the Tai Hu Light) are more that just hunks of silicon sitting as a trophy.

Like mentioned earlier, these supercomputers are often used to compute massive quantities of floating point calculations, whether that may be an AI algorithm trying to predict if Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton would win the election (whichever computer did that prediction was probably thrown out), or Google calculating how many more years it would take them to finally take over the planet. The point is that these supercomputer exist to prove how far that what we as humans have come since the days of 25MB memory cards for the PS2 and allow us to make calculations which may have otherwise taken thousands of years to do. All of this made possible with the existence of Linux.

##The future of supercomputers and Linux?

While it is unclear whether or not ten, twenty or even a hundred years later if Linux will still be the go to choice of OS for supercomputers, it is hard to see an alternative coming to light anytime soon considering the amount of support there is behind the open source, lightweight and extremely efficient OS that is Linux.
