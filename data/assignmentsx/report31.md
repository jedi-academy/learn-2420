#Linux Politics
by Kelvin

##Explain/define the topic?
Linus Torvalds is the creator of linux and believes that open source is the superior way to create software. He also only uses what he deems is the “best tools for the job” even if the tool that’s used is proprietary software. He was once criticized for his use of BitKeeper(Proprietary software) for version control in the Linux Kernel however he later went on to write a free-software to replace BitKeeper which we know as Git. He is also known for disagreeing with developers on the Linux kernel mailing list where a majority of announcements/discussions/debates over the kernel take place. 

##Who is behind it? 
As the person who has the highest authority in Linux, Torvalds retains the right to decide what is implemented in the Linux Kernel. However, Torvalds does not care much for being polite or politically correct and is known to cause flame wars on the internet. Due to his behaviour, many arguments were caused on the Linux kernel mailing list 

##What do they hope to achieve?
Torvalds is sponsored by the Linux Foundation so that he can work full-time improving Linux. 

##Where do they/it stand?
Because thousands of people have contributed to the Linux kernel roughly 2% of it is written by Torvalds as of 2006. Even now his main contribution is merging code written by others. However Torvalds has the highest authority and retains the right to decide if the new code will be incorporated into the Linux Kernel and monitors the use of it.

##How to use or play with the tech?
According to Linux Foundation, before contributing to the Linux kernel the Eudyptula Challenge should be completed first. The challenge consists of a series of programming exercises for the kernel. Unfortunately, the challenge isn’t currently accepting new applicants.
