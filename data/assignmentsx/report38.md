#Linux Security (grsecurity)
by Yusuke

## What is it?
Grsecurity is a security enhancement to the Linux kernel that defends against a variety of threats with the use of intelligent access control, memory corruption-based exploit prevention, and other systems that generally require no configuration. The set of security enhancements used to be free two years ago, but is restricted to paying sponsors ever since the Grsecurityâ€™s trademark was misused by an undisclosed company.

## Who is behind it?
A corporate is behind this system: the Open Source Security, Inc. On April 26, 2017 grsecurity developers handed over future maintenance of grsecurity test patches to the community.

## What do they hope to achieve?
They hope to shape how security works today and remain at the forefront. 

## Where does it stand?
They want to be the top of the security industry and stay ahead of the game by keeping up with the vulnerabilities and attacks that are possible to date. However, they are not very renowned in a good way.
