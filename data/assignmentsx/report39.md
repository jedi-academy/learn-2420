# LiMux: Munich’s Adoption of Linux and Open Source
by Brett

## What is LiMux?

LiMux is a project by the city of Munich, Germany to migrate their software to an open sourced model centred around Linux.  The objective of the project was to reduce Munich’s reliance on closed-source and coupled software to more open-sourced and uncoupled software.  It consists of three main components:

* **Operating System**:  A customized release of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and KDE SC 4.12 as Desktop.
* **Productivity Software:**  Mozilla Firefox (ESR), Mozilla Thunderbird (ESR), and LibreOffice 4.1.
* **Proprietary Software:**  Munich had a free Java application developed called **WoolMux** which does the following according to the Munich Government’s Standards and Practices:
    * Letterhead System
    * Form Creation System
    * Specially Formatted Text Blocks
    * Aids for Dispositions
    * Document Merge Control.

## Stakeholders

The City of Munich created the LiMux project to address their IT concerns.  Munich has a relatively socialist government compared to the more conservative cities in the rest of Germany.  This has led to the more government operations like IT being managed in house rather than outsourced.  Because of this way of working, the City Council of Munich was much more aware of the state of their IT operations.

The LiMux project was lead by Peter Hoffman.  He directed an in-house team that selected and developed the components of LiMux.  They evaluated bids from Open Source providers.

Ultimately it was Peter’s Team decided on **Debian** for its Linux platform, **Mozilla** for Internet browsing and email, and **OpenOffice** for its productivity suite.  Late in the project **OpenOffice** was replaced by **LibreOffice.**

## Why Go Open Source?

The City Council of Munich first considered going open source in 2003, when Microsoft announced it will no longer provide full support to Windows NT 4, which Munich was using.  Munich would have to replace the OS on their systems, which would affect the software their used.  Rather than sticking with Microsoft’s eco-system of products, Munich considered a model where its software was more independent and uncoupled from its operating system.

This consideration of an Open Source model did not go unnoticed by Microsoft.  In winter of 2003 Microsoft's then CEO Steve Ballmer, went to speak personally with Munich’s Mayor Christian Ude.  Ballmer warned Ude about the disadvantages about migrating away from Microsoft’s products.  The City Council ultimately ignored Ballmer’s warnings and moved ahead with a study on adopting Open Source.  By June 2004 the study was complete and the City Council voted in favour of migration to open-source and to open bidding.

## Achievements of LiMux

* LiMux was successfully implemented from 2006 to 2013. 
* As of October 2013 15,000 (of about 18, 000) desktop PC’s were migrated to LiMux from Windows NT 4 or Windows 2000.
* LiMux is the first Linux desktop distribution to be certified for industry use according to ISO 9241.
* LiMux is estimated to have cost a total of 19 Million Euros, but saved an estimated 10 Millions Euros in Microsoft License fees.
* LiMux has inspired other governments to adopt Open Source for IT needs like: China ([Kylin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylin_(operating_system))), France ([GendBuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GendBuntu)), Amsterdam (Open.Amsterdam), and Zargoza Spain (AZLinux).

## Criticisms of LiMux

### Long Migration

LiMux took approximately 7 years to complete its migration.  Many critics, including Microsoft, have pointed out that this long duration is why the migration was a bad idea.  Hewlett Packard (HP) created a report for Microsoft claiming it could migrate 50 to 500 PCs a day compared to the average of 8 a day that Peter Hoffman’s team was achieved.  However Peter Hoffman believes the slow pace was the reason the migration was successful.

Peter believes the slow migration limited the downtime of individual offices and departments because the plan did not require large groups to be down at the same time.  This meant the team didn’t have to rush an individual migration and could take the time to get it right.

They also had Munich workers first migrate from Microsoft Office to OpenOffice while still using Windows on their PC’s.  This helped the users understand the software they would be primarly using in a more familiar interface, before having to learn the Linux interface.

Peter’s team also took their time building the custom Linux distribution and interface of LiMux.  This was done to ensure that system would be as stable as possible.  This has led to a reduction and service calls from about 70/month during to Microsoft era to 50/month once LiMux was implemented.

### Reduction in Productivity

In 2014 unnamed officials in the Munich Government started to report that LiMux was a failure because it was reducing the productivity of its employees.  Claims that employees were "suffering" because of compatibility issues involving OpenOffice.  These issues were enough for Munich’s Deputy Mayor Josef Schmid to call for a review of Munich’s use of open source software.

These compatibility issues were addressed by switching to LibreOffice.  Because of the open source model it was very easy and quick to switch from OpenOffice to LibreOffice and this was done in under a year.

It was later revealed that loss of productivity was largely overblown and politically motivated.  The Mayor Dieter Reiter was a stakeholder in a proposal by Microsoft to move its German headquarters to Munich by 2016.  This would bring valuable jobs to Munich but also put pressure on the government to be more Microsoft friendly.

## Future of LiMux

Recently the City Council of Munich has considered abandoning LiMux.  Munich is considering moving away from open source and going back to Microsoft’s products.  This is largerly attributed to factors:  
* Munich’s ongoing IT issues.
* Munich still uses about 4000 PC’s running necessary Microsoft Products that LiMux cannot run.

In 2014 Munich as an independent consultant Accenture to do a review of its IT systems.  In 2017 Accenture released a report that identified serious concerns about Munich IT.  These problems however were not attributed to the use of LiMux, but instead the lack of compatible IT policies adopted by the various sub groups of Munich's IT department.

There are concerns that moving forward it will cost more to train employees on how to use LiMux or another open source solution.  The argument is that since Microsoft products are more common in an office work environment, new employees are more likely to be familiar with them and thus require less training.  This concerns are at odds with the fact the existing Munich workforce is already experienced with LiMux and LibreOffice and would be well equipped to assist new employees.

This November 2017 Munich will vote on how they should proceed in the future.  They will be considering Microsoft’s products, Upgrading LiMux, or adopting something entirely new like using more Web Based applications.
