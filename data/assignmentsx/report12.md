#Linux and gaming support
by Diego

##Explain/define the topic? 
Currently GNU/Linux desktops barely have quality video games developed specifically for them. Most of the professional companies in the industry focus their production on Microsoft Windows and on several video consoles marketed by big corporations such as Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft.

Although Linux has almost 35% in server market and virtually all supercomputers use Linux (99.6% market share), it still has limited success on the desktop sector, so the question that arises is why Linux has not achieved widespread penetration in the gaming market?

##Who is behind it? corp, product, individual 
The reason for this lack of penetration in the gaming market is that Linux has less than 2% participation in the desktop market and these figures obviously discourage most game developers from developing Linux versions of their games, because of the small audience that could play them.

The lack of corporate support of desktop PC manufacturers is a key factor for this low penetration. In the same way that in the mobile devices market the Android operating system achieved a great penetration and has practically come to dominate its market thanks to the support and promotion received from Google and top manufacturers of mobile devices such as Samsung, ASUS, Huawei, etc., Linux would need to receive a similar support from manufacturers in order to achieve a greater market share in the desktop sector.

##What do they hope to achieve? 
Gabe Newell, co-founder and executive director of Valve, the gaming company that in 2013 released its Steam web platform for Linux, said on an interview: “The center of gravity has shifted from console hardware platforms with price and access controlled by PC makers, to web-based free-to-play and massive multiplayer online games… Valve became convinced that Linux is the future of gaming.”

##Where do they/it stand? 
Linux tried to get corporate support, for example, through game distribution platforms, such as Steam. Steam, like Amazon Kindle is a platform for electronic books, Steam is for video games. And since 2013 Steam began to support games in Linux. More than 3,700 Linux games are now available on Steam. They went from only 50 titles available at launch 4 years ago to more than 3,700 today.

As a parallel move they began to develop a project to launch a gaming console based on Linux and a Linux distribution system called Steam OS, although these projects did not have the expected success.

##How to use or play with the tech?  
There are other distribution platforms similar to Steam, where gamers can find native Linux games, such as GOG.com, Portable Linux Games, Game Drift, and others. Lutris for examples is an open source gaming platform for GNU/Linux. It allows gamers to gather and manage (install, configure and launch) all the games acquired from any source, in a single interface.

But not being available a huge offer of native Linux games, an alternative is to take advantage of the most popular games available for Windows PC. The average user can install and run many popular Windows games in Linux with the help of tools such as Wine, PlayOnLinux and CrossOver. Wine, for example, is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications in systems like Linux and OS X. However, the situation is not optimal as compatibility issues may arise and for users with little technical experience can be cumbersome to manage them. 

In the coming years, with the proliferation of smartphones and other portable platforms with GNU/Linux-based systems, the advantage of Windows over Linux on the desktop field may decrease, and in the videogame arena it is possible that other companies may start to develop games for GNU/Linux.
