## Trusted Linux
by Yao Feng

The trusted Linux is a distribution that aims to provide extra security based on the National Security Agency’s SELinux. SELinux is often used to protect against potential terrorist attack since the 9/11. This system is used to coordinate and communicate with many government security departments such as CIA, department of defense, etc. to help them share different information and classified it at a different level of security. Before the Trusted Linux distribution is created the security required to manually share information. For example, securities must carry CDs, disks, or memory stick. Now with their application they can share and transfer information across the different secured networks. The trusted Linux is based on SELinux that already had complex security protections, however, it still lacks multi-level security in the past. In early 2005 they have developed the MLS (multi-level security) patch on their first version lease of Trusted Linux.

The company, Trusted Computer Solution Inc, who developed the Trusted Linux distribution is funded in 1994 and is based in Herndon. They develop a cross-domain solution of access, transferring data and information securely. They sell modularized application and extra plugins which can be deployed with less manpower and more efficiently. Those applications are developed on Sun’s Trusted Solaris. Solaris is a commercially available operating system and it is capable to MLS-based development. The difference between Trusted Solaris and Regular Solaris is Trusted Solaris had better controls and multi level of security (MLS). MLS two important functions: first one is to prevent users to access information higher classification than their security permission. Second, it to secure users cannot information after they have granted the access to it. In addition, the company also offers information system security, security certification, training, risk assessment, testing, vulnerability analysis service.

According to 2004 Government Security news survey 214 security professionals who working with federal security mandate. There are about 47% of their department is currently involved MLS infrastructure modernization initiative.

Today, Trusted Linux is more popular than the past. People are more concern about the security of information. Windows client machines have been targeted for attacks and is still increasing including attacks like virus, spyware, exploits and spam etc. Recent studies indicate that 80% of Windows machine had spyware installed. Therefore, the introduction of the Trusted Linux Client (TLC) project comes in to help users protect and secure information. TLC is build with Trusted Platform Module (TPM) security chips with trust characteristics such as digital signature, authentication of storage and simple integrity oriented Mandatory Access Control. The TLC is now implemented a lot on desktop and mobile Linux clients.
