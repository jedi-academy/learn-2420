#Linux and Home automation
by Ammar

Home automation may sound like a science-fiction dream, but in reality is is not only commonplace, but relatively simple to get started, especially with Linux. 

Being able to control your household appliances starts at the low end with plug and play radio frequency and relays that connect to a home and are in charge of scheduling and monitoring. At the high end, home automation may include environmental controls, security systems, and many other add-ons. Lighting and environmental control are the common form of home automation. You can set it to a certain time of day, week, month year or even season, or you can have them respond to sensor data and ambient light or temperature. In addition, almost any appliance can be remote controlled and operated by a computer/smart phone. These sensors and chips could be placed in almost anything in your home, from cookie jars to fridges and stoves. Some fridges are able to notify you what is inside your fridge from the comfort of your phone. They will also tell you what you can make with the stuff that’s inside the fridge and what the perfect meal for you is based on your mood, activity level, or even your diet restrictions. How many times have you left the house wondering if you had turned off your stove? With advanced technology you are able to check if the stove was left on and turn it off wirelessly. You are also able to adjust the temperature of the stove if you have anything cooking on it. 

Home automation system is the communication standard with which messages are relayed between components. The home automation has several, some proprietary and some open, some controlled by a single equipment vendor and some implemented by multiple manufactures.

The most widely known standard is X10 which is a protocol for controlling lights, appliances, and other electrical devices in your home to make it a smart home. The commands travel through the existing electrical lines in your home so no cabling is required. The X10 module address has two parts, the House code and the Unit code. The House code uses letter A through P, and the Unit code uses numbers 1 through 16. By doing so this allows you to have 16 modules for each house code for a total of 256 modules (16x16). Although it has a maximum signal rate of just 20 bits per second, its low cost is what makes it popular. It was created in 1975 but a newer standard called Insteon exists which includes a much higher signalling rate, built in error detection, retransmission, and hybrid RF and powerline communication. It is also backwards compatible. X10 is broad and there are many X10 devices that you can connect to a Linux computer over a standard RS-232 serial port.

Heyu is one of the most actively maintained X10 package for Linux. It runs on desktop Linux machines without requiring the overhead of a Web or database server, and it enables direct X10 control, event scheduling, and more. It is designed primarily to use the X10 CM11A serial port interface. Other models are also supported including the inexpensive and popular CM17A “Firecracker” module. The CM11A is primarily used because it supports two-way communication and has on board EEPROM storage for scheduling commands, complete with the battery backup. The two-way communication allows Heyu to query the state of other X10 devices in the home.

The Firecracker kit is a simple X10 home automation system, that consists of a lamp module, an appliance module, a hand held wireless transmitter that plugs into a standard RS-232 serial port. What this does is it allow the user to turn in or off any of up to 256 appliances, and brighten/dim any lamps. Each appliance must be plugged into its own module, and each module is set to a unique address by which it is identified. How it works is it’s a two-step process. First the computer sends signals to the Dynamite interface, which are then transmitted by radio signals to the special receiver/appliance module. This module then sends special pulses through the 110V line into which it is plugged to other modules (or intercepts the message itself). The module to which the message is addressed receives the message and turns on/off an appliance, or dims/brightens a lamp. There are also special shutters, garden hose and other modules to allow you to control many other things around the house.

Home automation is a growing area and in the future will most will be implement in most homes in the coming future with technology being integrated into most household appliances from fridges to stoves to lights, and lots more.
