#Seminar #6 - Working With Logs
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Fall 2017

##Overview

The goal is to evaluate an assigned open-source log monitoring / management tool,
in four similar-sized teams per set.

Each team will prepare a summary of their tool, using the guideline below, and
have 10 minutes to demo it in class.

##Lab Teams

This is a team lab, with self-assigned team composition.
If you accidentally end up in the wrong team, see me in lab to fix it.

##Lab Submission

Submit your summary, in markdown format, by the end of the day (17:30).

The summaries will be shared with the class once I have vetted them.

There is a rubric for this lab, that I will use for grading.

##The Tools

There are four candidate open-source tools:

- [Alioth Logcheck](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/logcheck/)
- [Elastic Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash)
- [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org/)
- [Logwatch](https://sourceforge.net/projects/logwatch/)

These came from https://www.tecmint.com/best-linux-log-monitoring-and-management-tools/

##The Targets

There are two servers to consider using the tool for:

- a system hosting 50 webapps on Apache & MySQL; low-traffic (2-5 GB/month)

- a system hosting two webapps on Apache & MySQL; moderate-traffic (5-7 GB/day)

#The Lab

**Ask for clarification if needed!**
