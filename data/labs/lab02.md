##Lab Teams

This is an individual lab, although there is merit to working in parallel with a 
partner, for support. You need individual submissions, even in that case.

##Lab Submission

The "lab02" dropbox has been setup for you to use for this lab.

**Before completing step 15** in the lab exercise, where you remove your "vacation"
directory, make a zip of your home directory.
Submit this zip to the lab02 dropbox.

Due: Sunday, Sep 24, 17:30 PST

##Lab Marking Guideline

I am not planning a rubric for this lab, instead starting with a perfect score
and deducting for minor (1 mark) or major (2 marks) booboos.

#Finally, The Lab

I will tell a few stories (below) at the beginning of each section of
the lab :)

##File systems

- Linux/Unix/Mac vs Windows
- mount points
- distribution differences

##Locating files

- absolute vs relative
- folder separators

##Managing files

- file system cautions
- case sensitivity!

##Path expansion

- globbing!
