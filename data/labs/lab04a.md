#Seminar #4a - Monitor and Manage Processes
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Winter 2018

##Kickoff

At the beginning of our seminar, I will answer any questions
you have about permissions (Chapter 6), and then want to
talk about processes (Section 7.1).

###Processes Lecturette

- big vs small
- parent vs child
- heavy vs light
- spawn vs fork
- background vs foreground
- daemon or not
- kernel vs user
- process differences between platforms
- Job vs Process vs Thread vs Fiber(?)
- shell scripts as jobs?

###Exercise

Once the notion of processes is clear, read/work through the
rest of Chapter 7 in your student guide, to make sure
you "get" the basics of processes.

You want to be able to:
- explain what a Linux process is
- demonstrate the basic commands to manipulate processes

Caution: you will need to use a grain of salt with some of the student
guide. It relies on the environment procided by the classroom
server (eg `hippo` process), which doesn't match ours exactly.
We will need to improvise a bit :-/

###Alternate Exercise

If you find the student guide too hard to follow without the classroom server,
here is an alternate set of exercises that should achieve the same purpose.
Do them instead of (or in addition to) the student guide exercises, but
using the student guide and Linux help (remember that from earlier?)
as needed.

- Run Firefox in the background ...
- Run gedit in the background ...
- Run gnome-calculator ...
- Suspend the calculator process ...
- Send it to the background ...
- View which processes are running in the background ...
- Send the calculator process to the foreground ...
- Cancel the calculator process ...
- Log in as root in another terminal window ...
- Find the PID of Firefox ...
- Cancel Firefox using the pid ...
- Verify that Firefox was cancelled via the command line  ...
- Cancel all gedit processes  ...

###Submission?

Nothing has to be handed in for this part of the seminar...
that is for part 2 :)
