##Lab Teams

This is an individual lab, although there is merit to working in parallel with a 
partner, for support. You need individual submissions, even in that case.

##Lab Submission

The "lab03" dropbox has been setup for you to use for this lab.

**At time of prep, working on the script to verify successful completion**

Due: Sunday, Oct 1, 17:30 PST

##Lab Marking Guideline

I am not planning a rubric for this lab, instead starting with a perfect score
and deducting for minor (1 mark) or major (2 marks) booboos.
