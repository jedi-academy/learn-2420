# Lab #8 - Managing Networking
ACIT2420 - BCIT - Winter 2019

## Overview

You have learned lots about networking concepts and configuration in ACIT2620.
This seminar is meant to complement that, by managing network connections
from the command line, using **nmcli**.

The student guide refers to IP addresses in the 172.25.x.x range.
That is how the Red Hat classroom server would be setup, while
our addresses are assigned in a 142.232.x.x range in lab.
Adjust commands and examples accordingly.

**CAUTION: the lab writeup in the student guide has you reboot part way through.
You need to save your terminal history in a test file _before_ rebooting,
and append to it after rebooting. If you don't, you run the tisk of having to 
repeat part of the lab :'(**

## Lab parts, per the student guide

We will be concentrating on the third section of Chapter 11, "Configuring networking with nmcli".

Remember what you learned in 2620, and in previous work in this course!

## Lab Teams?

This is an individual lab.

##Lab Submission

**CAUTION: the lab writeup in the student guide has you reboot part way through.
You need to save your terminal history in a test file _before_ rebooting,
and append to it after rebooting. If you don't, you run the tisk of having to 
repeat part of the lab :'(**

Complete the guided exercise in section 11.6, after reading section 11.5,
"Configuring networking with nmcli". Save your log or a screenshot of the last portion of
it for submission.

Complete the "lab" (MANAGING RED HAT ENTERPRISE LINUX
NETWORKING), the last section in Chapter 11 of the student guide, again with a log
or screenshot(s).

When you complete the Red Hat lab steps, adjust the IP address range as appropriate.

We don't have the `lab network grade` script, so we will fake it:
- display your network configuration
- display the contents of your hosts file

Save the contents of the terminal window in a text file, and submit it to
the lab08 dropbox.

**CAUTION: the lab writeup in the student guide has you reboot part way through.
You need to save your terminal history in a test file _before_ rebooting,
and append to it after rebooting. If you don't, you run the tisk of having to 
repeat part of the lab :'(**

After three strong warnings about saving your log/history before rebooting, 
we will have no sympathy for students who don't ... and who might have to repeat some of the
lab.
