#Seminar #7 - Managing Networking
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Fall 2017

##Overview

We're going to stick with more of a "by the book" approach for this seminar.

The "lesson" corresponds to section 11.1.

We want to work through the balance of the chapter, culminating in the "lab"
found in section 11.11, with notes below.

The student guide refers to IP addresses in the 172.25.x.x range.
That is how the Red Hat classroom server would be setup, while
our addresses are assigned in a 142.232.x.x range in lab.
Adjust commands and examples accordingly.

##Lab parts, per the student guide

- validating network configuration
- configuring networking with `nmcli`
- editing network configuration files
- configuring hostnames

##Lab Teams?

This is an individual lab.

##Lab Submission

Completion of the "lab", section 11.11 in the student guide, will result
in your submission.

In a new terminal window, complete the 11.11 lab steps, adjusting the IP
address range as appropriate.

We don't have the `lab network grade` script, so we will fake it:
- display your network configuration
- display the contents of your hosts file

Save the contents of the terminal window in a text file, and submit it to
the lab07 dropbox.
