Summarize it
The Tool
Name: Graylog

Description: Graylog is a fully integrated, high customizable and open source log management system that enables System Administrators to collect, index, and analyze both framed, systematic and disorganized data from just about any available source systems.

Origin: The Graylog project was started by Lennart Koopmann sometime around 2009. Back then the most prominent log management software vendor was so expensive that Koopmann decided to write a log management system himself. Although one might think he overacted the situation back then was considered hopeless because there was basically no other product on the market and especially no open source alternatives. 

Claim to fame (what sets it apart from others): Graylog’s logging system is highly pluggable and enables centralized log management from many systems. Graylog can work on data from any log source, it has a variety of filters and is integrated with external components such as MongoDB for metadata and Elasticsearch which is used to keep logfiles and enable text search.


Your experience (1-3 paragraphs)
What we found was that the starting process seems like it could take a while for anyone to do, especially if you are working with multiple machines, but after that it should be easier to use. In addition Graylog has a user friendly dashboard which shows useful information and generates histograms. 
You are able to create widgets to send information for certain criteria; for example, if you want to only see the information for messages and process_id that is found in the past 8 days, you can add that to your dashboard so that the only information you get is this and it will not clutter your screen. 
Also, these dashboards are able to send alerts if there are any issues that arise. In the end we were able to filter the log messages and look through its remote address, timestamp and other important information.

Evaluation (1=poor, 5=excellent) ... add notes if needed
Installation - [2]
Requires a lot to just get started to install before you can even use it.

Documentation - [4]
It is detailed but there’s a lot more then we would need and it can make finding what we wanted to look for less than ideal.

Ease of use - [3]
Everything is pretty much well laid out on their site but we had problems in the terminal.

Overhead - [5]
Free, and open source.

Quality of results -[3]
The result were both textual and visual with helpful histograms which were created by Graylog

Recommendation? - [3]
The initial setup is a ‘little’ confusing, but once that is done Graylog could prove itself to be a quality tool.
