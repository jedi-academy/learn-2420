##Lab Teams

This is an individual lab, although there is merit to working in parallel with a 
partner, for support. You need individual submissions, even in that case.

##Lab Submission

The "lab01" dropbox has been setup for you to use for this lab.

See the end of this writeup for the file you need to submit.

Due: Sunday, Sept 16, 17:30 PST

##Lab Marking Guideline

I am not planning a rubric for this lab, instead starting with a perfect score
and deducting for minor (1 mark) or major (2 marks) booboos.

#Finally, The Lab

I will tell a few stories at the beginning of each section of
the lab :)

##File systems (20 mins)

- Linux/Unix/Mac vs Windows
- mount points
- distribution differences

##Locating files (25 mins)

- absolute vs relative
- folder separators

##Managing files (35 mins)

- file system cautions
- case sensitivity!

##Path expansion (20 mins)

- globbing!

##Lab Exercise (20 mins)

Complete the lab exercise, 2.9 in your student guide.

Use the "tree" command to build your submission:

- yum install tree
- cd ~
- tree > mytree.txt

And submit the mytree.txt file to your dropbox.
