##Lab Teams

This is an individual lab - you each want your development environment working!

There is merit to working in parallel with a partner from your set, for support,
but you need individual submissions.

##Lab Submission

The "lab01" dropbox has been setup for you to use for this lab.

Before exiting your bash shell at the end of the lab exercise,
use the "file>save contents" menu option to save the command and output history
into a local text file. That file should be submitted to your dropbix.

Also submit a screenshot of your VirtualBox manager screen, showing the
configuration of your "client" VM.

Due: Sunday, Sep 17, 17:30 PST

##Lab Marking Guideline

I am not planning a rubric for this lab, instead starting with a perfect score
and deducting for minor (1 mark) or major (2 marks) booboos.
