#Seminar #4b - Managing Processes
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Fall 2017

##Overview

I am working on replicating the environment that the Red Hat
Classroom Server would setup, to complete the lab exercise (7.9).

Details will be provided closer to our seminar session.

##Lab Teams

This is an individual lab, although there is merit to working in parallel with a 
partner, for support. You need individual submissions, even in that case.
