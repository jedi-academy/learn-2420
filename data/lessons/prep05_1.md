#Seminar #5 Online Prep
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Fall 2017

I am working up a good lab for you to do in class this week, and am going to
follow the spirit of last week's lab, though not so long.

No survey this week -> we will try a quiz at the beginning of each session
instead :)

Background reading for this week: 
- https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-etc-services-2196940
- http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/control-linux-start-services-daemons/
- http://www.ixwebhosting.com/support/st_kb/managing-services-on-linux-servers/

The above present slightly different interpretations of the same subject,
Linux services :-/
