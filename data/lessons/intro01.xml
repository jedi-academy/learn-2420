    <slide title="Resources" layout="normal">
        <p>RH Academy portal ... see D2L for the link to signup.
            This gives you access to HTML student guides for
            any courses you "buy".
            <b>This is an off-campus resource, and the BCIT privacy policies
                apply. A written consent will be required of all students
                who wish to proceed!</b>
        </p>
        <p>RH Classroom server ... Red Hat has a classroom server, mentioned
            in and assumed by the student guide. We are not using that,
            and will have to make allowances.</p>
        <p>You will setup CentOS on your own systems ... one instance to start with, 
            using a VirtualBox VM. Later on, we will use VMware and also the Pi.</p>

    <slide title="Deviating from Normal ..." layout="normal">
        <p>A few things are different in this course, compared to CST,
            but you are already familiar with them :)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flipped Learning - weekly readings/watchings will be assigned,
                some with a D2L survey to complete 
                by the evening before that week's seminar.
            </li>
            <li>Flipped LMS - our course hub has deep links into D2L,
                rather than the other way around.</li>
            <li>"Authentic" assessment - hands-on labs, with proof of successful
                completion; hands-on midterm and maybe hands-on final!</li>
        </ul>
