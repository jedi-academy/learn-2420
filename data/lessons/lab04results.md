#Seminar #6 Survey Results
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Winter 2018

I have gone through all of the lab 4 submissions, and the chart showing your
ratings is shown below.

**Note**  
The lab called for a one-page writeup of the tool you evaluated. 
Some of you have had unhelpful writeups, which I gave a poor grade to.
An example:

_I used X. It was easy to install and use. And it was colorful._

That doesn't give the reader a whole lot of explanation of the tool,
or what it is like to work with, or what it might be used for.

An [example writeup](/download/Lab4b-MonitoringTools.pdf) which was a lot more helkpful (student name redacted).
