#Seminar #7 Network Management
ACIT2420 - BCIT - Fall 2018

You have learned lots about networking concepts and configuration in ACIT2620.
This seminar is meant to complement that, by managing network connections
from the command line, using **nmcli**.

For prep, I suggest you skim the first two sections in Chapter 11: network concepts, and
validating network configuration.
