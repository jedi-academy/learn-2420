#Seminar #2 Survey Results
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Fall 2017

The survey results are in. There were only two respondents who said their
normal desktop was MacOS -> not statistically significant, and I have omitted
them from the survey analysis.

I "normalized" the rest of the results, and made a word map for the similarities
and for the differences. Check them out below :)
