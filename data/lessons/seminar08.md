# Seminar #8 Grokking Processes
ACIT2420 - BCIT - Winter 2019

### Processes Lecturette

- big vs small processes ... memory-intensive
- parent vs child processes
- heavy vs light processes ... dedicated vs shared resources
- spawned vs forked processes ... asynch vs synch
- background vs foreground processes
- daemon or not
- kernel vs user vs "userland" processes

- process differences between platforms ... metadata, scheduling, 
- Job vs Process vs Thread (preemptive) vs Fiber (cooperative)
- shell scripts as jobs?

- commands
    - kill, killall
    - pkill
    - pgrep

- tools
    - `htop` can replace `top`

### Practice

Once the notion of processes is clear, complete what you can of the guided exercises
in Chapter 7 in your student guide, to make sure
you "get" the basics of processes.

You want to be able to:
- explain what a Linux process is
- demonstrate the basic commands to manipulate processes

Caution: you will need to use a grain of salt with some of the student
guide. It relies on the environment provided by the classroom
server (eg `hippo` process), which doesn't match ours exactly.
We will need to improvise a bit :-/

### Further Reading?

The article below will enrich your life, 
with some conceptual process concepts! 

- [Computing processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)) - 
yes, Wikipedia, but conceptually practical

Better strategy: skim the article before class, and bring questions.
Then, after our seminar, re-read it ... it should make more sense!
