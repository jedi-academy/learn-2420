#Open Source

##The Cathedral and the Bazaar

Something that was clear last week was, that you collectively do not
have a broad understanding of Linux, or of the open source culture
it is part of. 
Many people use open source software because it is "free", but many
others use it because they agree with and/or support the culture surrounding it.

This "open source culture" was best explained in an essay, "The Cathedral and the Bazaar",
written by Eric Raymond in 1997-1999. It is essential reading for those
who hope to see beyond the "free" label of OSS, or those who should.
As an IT professional, especially for any work in devops or system 
administration, you cannot avoid open source tools. That makes you part of the group who
should see "beyond free".

##Lessons for creating good open source software

From Eric Raymond's [essay](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/).
The most important lessons (IMHO) have been bolded.

Raymond points to 19 "lessons" learned from various software development efforts, 
each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:

1.     Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
2.     Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
3.     **Plan to throw one [version] away**; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks' The Mythical Man-Month)
4.     If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
5.     When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
6.     Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
7.     **Release early. Release often.** And listen to your customers.
8.     Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
9.     Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
10.     If you **treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource**, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
11.     The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
12.     Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
13.     Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry)
14.     Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
15.     When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
16.     When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.
17.     A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
18.     To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
19. Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.
