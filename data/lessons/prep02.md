#Seminar #2 Online Prep
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Winter 2018

Something that was clear last week was, that you collectively do not
have a broad understanding of Linux, or of the open source culture
it is part of. 
Many people use open source software because it is "free", but many
others use it because they agree with and/or support the culture surrounding it.

This "open source culture" was best explained in an essay, "The Cathedral and the Bazaar",
written by Eric Raymond in 1997-1999. It is essential reading for those
who hope to see beyond the "free" label of OSS, or those who should.
As an IT professional, especially for any work in devops or system 
administration, you cannot avoid open source tools. That makes you part of the group who
should see "beyond free".

Read the essay. Then take the survey linked to in the organizer to let me know about any topics, raised by
your reading, that you would like me to expound on in class. 

Three sources, catoring to different learning styles...
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) has
the highlights of the essay, and links to...
- Eric Raymond's [online version](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/) of the essay,
which can be a bit hard to navigate, so fortunately we have...
- Stefan Unsterstein hosts a [PDF version](http://www.unterstein.net/su/docs/CathBaz.pdf) of the essay

The essay PDF contains 40 pages, but the last 10 of those are end notes and commentary, not 
needed unless you are curious.
