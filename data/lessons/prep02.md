#Seminar #2 Online Prep
ACIT2420 - BCIT - Winter 2019

The student guide has an introduction to Linux, but it can be a bit dry. 
We will be going through the first two
chapters in class this week, but you might like to watch a video 
before class: from Grant McWilliams, 
[Linux: Overview and Installation](https://www.lynda.com/Linux-tutorials/Linux-Overview-Installation/514199-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a18%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3acentos+7%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2).

You can access this through the BCIT library online - you are entitled to a lynda.com account without having to pay for it :)
You may have to do a search for it once you get through to lynda.com, as you will
get there through our library portal.

The video is about an hour long, but it could help if you are still having problems
getting your CentOS installed.
