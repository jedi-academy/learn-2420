#Seminar #2 Online Prep
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Fall 2017

We will be continuing with the RH124 material this week, using the "desktop"
VM that you setup last week.

Something that was clear last week was, that you collectively do not
have a broad understanding of Linux.

Fortunately, Red Hat has a [Linux Technical Overview](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/rh024-red-hat-linux-technical-overview)
short video series, to provide some background and context.

Follow the above link, and you will have to register (yet again, sigh), but
the videos will help orient you to the Linux environment.

Please watch the first five of those short videos (#5 is "What is the Linux Kernel 
and What is User Space?"), which should take about 45 minutes.
Then complete the week 3 survey linked to in the organizer. 
There are no right or wrong answers -
I want to understand how *you* perceive Linux, and to share the
summarized survey results with the class.

**Note:** D2L is giving me the gears and not letting me assemble the survey properly.
I will enable the link once it is ready, and post a message on our slack channel.
Feel free to watch the videos in the meantime - the survey isn't based on specific
content from them :-/
