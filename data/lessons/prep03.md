#Seminar #3 Online Prep
ACIT2420 - BCIT - Fall 2018

We are going to dive into shell scripting this week, which is danced around
in the incredibly-awkward-to-navigate student guide. I am working up a
separate seminar to deal with the scripting, along the lines of ACIT2520.

As preparation for the seminar, please **work through Chapter 4 in the student guide**: 
creating, viewing and editing text files.

You can "cheat" (for now) by using the graphical text editor (`Applications>Accessories>Text Editor`),
but you will need to know how to use the text editor from the command line.

Aside: I now have access to the same student guide that you do. I created a bogus account
for myself, and approved it. So, I get to share your pain. I still don't have
access to the current Red Hat instructor resources , but will work on that, as
well as provide Red Hat some feedback on the new, "improved" student guide :-/
