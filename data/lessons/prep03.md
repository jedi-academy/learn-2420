#Seminar #3 Online Prep
ACIT2420 - BCIT - Winter 2019

We are going to dive into shell scripting this week, which is danced around
in the incredibly-awkward-to-navigate student guide. I am working up a
separate seminar to deal with the scripting, along the lines of ACIT2520.

As preparation for the seminar, please **work through Chapter 4 in the student guide**: 
creating, viewing and editing text files.
There is nothing to hand in - we just want you to be able to
do basic text file editing from the command line.

You can "cheat" (for now) by using the graphical text editor (`Applications>Accessories>Text Editor`),
but you will need to know how to use the text editor from the command line,
especially once we get into the server version of CentOS (no GUI).
