#Seminar #3 Online Prep
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Fall 2017

Experiment time: I would like you to complete Chapter 3 (Getting Help)
from the RH124 student guide, on your own, BUT keeping track of the time
it takes you to do so. That will be one of the two questions in this
week's survey.

---------------------
Fortunately, Red Hat has a [Linux Technical Overview](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/rh024-red-hat-linux-technical-overview)
short video series, to provide some background and context.

Follow the above link, and you will have to register (yet again, sigh), but
the videos will help orient you to the Linux environment.

Please watch the first five of those short videos (#5 is "What is the Linux Kernel 
and What is User Space?"), which should take about 45 minutes.
Then complete the week 3 survey linked to in the organizer. 
There are no right or wrong answers -
I want to understand how *you* perceive Linux, and to share the
summarized survey results with the class.
