#Seminar #7 Networking Concepts
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Fall 2017

Networks are part of the fabric of our lives, and Linux is at the heart of
much of the underlying technology.

Section 10.1 in our student guide addresses network concepts, but I suspect there
is a log of overlap with ACIT2620.

The key concepts:
- TCP/IP
- UDP/IP
- DNS
- DHCP
- gateway
- OSI layers model
- netmask
- routing
- ping
