#Seminar #13 Wrapup & Review  
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Winter 2018

No quiz this week. You're welcome.

##Archiving & Copying

Read Chapter 12, Archiving & Copying Files Between Systems.

We are not going to do a lab based on it. The important commands:

- tar -> tarfiles, tarballs
- scp -> Q&D transfer
- rsync -> briefcase? you can setup a cron job to backup automatically

I will review these in class, and answer questions.

##Assignment Wrapup

We are going to wrapup assignment 3 this week - your chance to attack another
team's hardened Pi :) or several of them :D

An attack should only take 10-15 minutes.
Do not flood the network with traffic - be respectful of everyone else
in the building sharing the network.

##Review

I am preparing a review lesson to use in class. It will likely be posted late Sunday or early Monday.

##Evaluations

We have course evaluations for you to complete this week, and I
have made my own feedback survey to help make the next iteration of the course.
More on that in class :)
