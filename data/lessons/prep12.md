# Seminar #12 Network Management
ACIT2420 - BCIT - Winter 2019

You have learned lots about networking concepts and configuration in ACIT2620.
This seminar is meant to complement that, by managing network connections
from the command line, using **nmcli**.

For prep, I suggest you skim the first two sections in Chapter 11: network concepts, and
validating network configuration.

## Archiving & Copying

Read Chapter 12, Archiving & Copying Files Between Systems, and bring questions to class.

We are not going to do a lab based on it. The important commands:

- tar -> tarfiles, tarballs
- scp -> Q&D transfer
- rsync -> briefcase? you can setup a cron job to backup automatically

We will say a few words about these in class, and answer questions.
