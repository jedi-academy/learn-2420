#Seminar #8 Exchanging Files & Installing Packages?
ACIT2420 - BCIT - Fall 2018

We are addressing hardening in lab this week, and not the above :-/
In fact, you have already done most of what is covered in the
two chapters - 12 (Archiving and Copying Files Between Systems) and 
13 (Installing and Updating Software Packages).

I suggest you give them a quick once over, and bring questions to class.

The big deal with Chapter 12 is understanding the **tar**, **scp** and **sync** commands.

The big deal with Chapter 13 is understanding & working with **RPM** and **yum**.

##Ok, so what are we doing, really?

We are going to talk about **security & hardening**, 
getting a head start on start on assignment 3 as it were.

This is a "loaded" topic (heavy, subject to opinionated interpretation, impossible
to prove absolutely, a bottomless pit for time & resources), and I want to walk
you through it in class.

In preparation, you should read Chapter 1,
[Overview of Security Topics](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/security_guide/index),
in the RHEL 7 Security Guide, and then complete the D2L survey (for a mark) I have posted.

More material will be posted before class, but I recommend that you not start the assignment
until we have talked about this in class!
