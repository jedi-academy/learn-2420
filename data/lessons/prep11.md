#Seminar #11 Assignment 3
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Winter 2018

We are going to start on assignment 3 this week - hardening your CentOS installation.

This is a "loaded" topic (heavy, subject to opinionated interpretation, impossible
to prove absolutely, a bottomless pit for time & resources), and I want to walk
you through it in class.

In preparation, you should read Chapter 1,
[Overview of Security Topics](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/security_guide/index),
in the RHEL 7 Security Guide, and then complete the D2L survey (for a mark) I have posted.
I didn't get it up as early as I wanted to, so have set the closing time for 11:30pm Sunday.

More material will be posted before class, but I recommend that you not start the assignment
until we have talked about this in class!
