#Seminar #4 Online Prep
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Winter 2018

Lab this week will be spent working on and completing your Assignment 1,
using the Raspberry Pi.

You seem pretty interested in the Pi, so I thought it appropriate to
provide you with some background, and to encourage you to think outside
the box about Pi applications.
I have some reading for you to do, to stimulate the appetite as it were,
and then a survey for you, 
linked to in the organizer entry for this preparation task.

Readings:
- The inside story of the Raspberry Pi, [We thought we'd sell 1,000](http://www.zdnet.com/article/we-thought-wed-sell-1000-the-inside-story-of-the-raspberry-pi/)
- There is even/also a video, [Eben Upton - The Story of Raspberry Pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCt6d0SCxO4)

Read those, think about you would/could/should do with a Pi or two, and then take
the survey. Completing the survey will count as a successful quiz for grading.
