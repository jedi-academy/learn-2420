#Seminar #4 Online Prep
ACIT2420 - BCIT - Winter 2019

This week's topic is managing users and groups.
Those are restricted abilities, which means that you need
elevated privileges, i.e. using `sudo` or `su`.

I know you are dying to know the difference, and would like you
to read two online tutorials as preparation for this week's
seminar:

- [A beginner's guide to understanding sudo on Ubuntu](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/sudo-beginners-guide/)
- [Understanding the difference between sudo and su](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/sudo-vs-su/) - 
    followup to the first reading

I am not planning a quiz on this, so you are off the hook for that.
We will, however, be unsympathetic if you get stuck using them in lab!
