#Seminar #4 Online Prep
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Fall 2017

Continuing our deviation/acceleration from the original plan, this week
is all about processes.

Please read both of the webpages below, which are intended to equip
you with some conceptual understanding of processes,
and then complete the D2L survey
for Week 4. They may not be the most pleasant or entertaining read,
and I don't expect you to "learn" or memorize the contents -
they are intended to give you a better understanding of what
operating systems, and Linux in particular, think a "process" is.

Readings:
- Computing processes on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)) - 
yes, Wikipedia, but conceptually practical
- [Linux processes](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/tlk/kernel/processes.html) -
dated, but good description of the principles and mechanisms

Note: file & folder permissions are important, but not complicated.
I will say a few words about these at the beginning of our seminar,
and encourage you to read Chapter 6 (Controlling access to files with
file system permissions) at your convenience.
