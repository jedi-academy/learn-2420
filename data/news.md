## Week 12 - Apr 2/3


## Week 11 - Mar 26/27

We are going to have some "fun" with logs and their analysis this week!

### Week 10 - Mar 19/20

We have out own Pi-day(s) this week, with assignment 2 :)

Yes, that means you should bring your Pi!

The assignment is deceptively simple. Some of you will breeze through it, while others will struggle.

### Midterms

The midterms have been marked and analyzed. A significant portion of the
problems encountered are what I consider "programming logic" problems
with your scripts. Programming logic is not part of the learning outcomes for ACIT2420,
and we have made a fairness adjustment. 

The midterm results will be treated as out of 37 instead of 42 because of this.
The maximum mark will be 37 - those who did well originally don't get a bonus!

### Week 9 - Mar 5/6

The ultimate goal this week is setting up secure access to your "server", 
which should be a second (for us) CentOS VM. 

The week after spring break, you will be working on assignment 2,
and setting up your Pi to be a server running CentOS 7 too.
Details will not be posted until late in spring break week, to encourage
you to take some downtime.

Reminder: spring break is Mar 11-15!

### Week 8 - Feb 26/27

We are talking and walking processes this week, and we're not talking about
CuisinArt!

Chris & I are working on marking the midterms ... no promises that they will be 
ready for you!

### Food for thought 

If this doesn't give you nightmares, nothing will!

No, it won't be on the midterm

### Week 7 - Feb 19

- Midterm time!!  
- Tues 10:45-12:45 in DTC-581 (sets A & B) / 578 (set C)
- open book, open internet, just no "ask a friend"
- preparation: last term's midterm is on D2L, in the "Study Aids" content section
- content: you will be building a shell script, with multiple parts in it, each for
part of the midterm grade

Chris & I are doing our best to catch up with marking. No guarantees for lab04,
however, as its due date is Sunday.

### Week 6 - Feb 12/13

Prep: reading
Lab: File Permissions
See organizer tab below

**NOTE**: I am making a slight adjustment to the
course schedule, handling "file permissions" in class
rather than leaving it to your spare time.
Dealing with "processes" gets bumped to the week after our 
midterm, and this will also involve a lighter treatment of
"hardening Linux" at the end of the course.
