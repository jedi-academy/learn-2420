**Rethink**

Two things have been bugging me about the 3620 schedule:

- my original plan for handling the weeks where we lose our seminar because of holidays
- my recent discovery that this is the only course with a focus on Linux (others use Linux,
don't focus on it)

I am adjusting the weekly schedule to address these, as follows:

- week 6: no seminar (Family Day); assignment 2 started on your own (no new skills needed)
- week 7: midterm (hands-on based on weeks 1-5; prep readings on shell scripting)
- weeks 8-10: seminars on services/daemons, logs, and networking; with spring break in there too,
not counting as one of the weeks;
quiz & lab on each topic
- week 11: assignment 3 (needs these last 3 topics)
- week 12: no seminar (Easter Monday); assignment completion on your own
- week 13: seminar on backups; review; pi vs pi playoffs
- week 14: exam

Not addressed: advanced shell scripting, file systems & virtualization,
proper hardening

**Week 6**  
No seminar, but I have posted the next assignment for those craving
their weekly "Linux fix".

**Week 5**  
Weekend reading posted.  
I have gone through the surveys and answered some of the questions.
The rest will make for a lively seminar start this week :)

Lab 4 posted.
