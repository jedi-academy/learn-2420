**CentOS on your Pi**  
The article linked to in the writeup explains the process of installing CentOS on a Pi,
but does not reference the most up-to-date version of Centos.
It also references a minimal install, with no GUI :-O

Try
http://mirror.centos.org/altarch/7.4.1708/isos/aarch64/CentOS-7-aarch64-rootfs-7.4.1708.tar.xz
instead ... a "proper" version with a GUI.

Alternately, the NOOBS install SD card, which many of you have already, can
setup CentOS for you.

**Lab 4**  
These labs have been graded, and the ratings tallied.
See the week 5 tab for details.

**Week 7 (midterm)**  
I bet you're happy to have the midterm behind you!  
A solution has been posted in the content/midterm section on D2L;
the files are named `zsetup.sh` and `zwork.sh`.

I have marked the midterms, and published the feedback on D2L.  
I started out posting comments about what was wrong with incorrect
answers, but that was taking waaaaaay too long, so I reverted to
choosing the appropriate part mark, as appropriate.

The class average was 37/60 (62%), and the median was 42/60 (70%).
Results ranged from a low of 0 to a high of 56 (93%).
Do take a look at your results, and I will answer questions about
the midterm next week in class.

-------------------

Reminder: I have tweaked the schedule and topics for the balance
of the course.
