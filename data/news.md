**Week 7 (midterm)**  
I bet you're happy to have the midterm behind you!  
A solution has been posted in the content/midterm section on D2L;
the files are named `zsetup.sh` and `zwork.sh`.

Reminder: I have tweaked the schedule and topics for the balance
of the course.

**Week 6**  
No seminar, but I have posted the next assignment for those craving
their weekly "Linux fix".
