You should have registered for the Red Hat Academy, and gotten access
to the SysAdmin I Student Guide. 
You should also have VirtualBox installed, with a CentOS VM.

**Welcome to ACIT2420**

Welcome to ACIT2420, Linux System Administration :)

Our first session will be Weds Sept 5th.
The ACIT2520 and 2420 seminars will be split in two, so that Michal
and I can introduce our courses to both sets.
