**Week 3** (Tue 19:40)  

- Survey analysis posted
- Reading & lab posted.
- Note: there were three late survey submissions (1-3 hours). Those don't help,
since I am not going to wait until then to start collating & analyzing responses.
Surveys need to be in "on time" or I cannot consider them, sorry.

Course hub updates will be posted on https://acit3620.slack.com, which you
can join with a my.bcit.ca email address.
