**Assignment 3**  
I have agreed to extend the deadline for assignment 3, to Monday evening.
This will give you a chance to perform attacks on other teams' Pis during
lab. You will not have the whole lab for this, but hopefully an hour.

I want to address any missing bits of system administration, and to
do a review. Details posted for the weekend :)

**Week 11**  
Security talking points and assignment 3 posted. Bring your Pi!

There will be a quiz this week, on logging (chapter 10).

**Week 10**  
This week's seminar (lab 7) is posted ... there is no specific prep
to do this week (enjoy the remaining hours of your spring break).

We will be working with Chapter 11, Managing Linux Networking.

There will be a quiz this week, on services and daemons (chapters 8/9).
