**Course Grading - Dec 12**  
I will post here a summary of marking progress.

- Final exam graded ... average 67%, lowest 57% (no failures), highest 87% (congrats Carson)
- assignment 2 graded & feedback published
- lab 7 graded & published

**Week 13/14 - Dec 4/5**  

Yes, I am week-numbering-challenged.

This week's class is a wrapup/review, and you should have some time for any last
minute work needed for assignment 3.



**Week 12 - Nov 19/20**  
The last part of the midterm solution has been posted on D2L,
together with an updated readme for it.

This week's seminar was there since last week :-/

**Week 11 - Nov 12/13**

This week's seminar is posted. We're going to dive into network
management from the command line.

Next week's material, and even the final assignment for the week following,
have been posted too, to give you some flexibility with your time
management as the term starts to wind up (or down, depending on your perspective).

**Week 10 - Nov 6/7**  
Assignment #2 is posted, for those who want to start on it
before next week's lab period :)

**Week 9 - Oct 30/31**  
Prep reading & this week's lab posted in the organizer tab below.

**Week 8 - Oct 23/24**  
There is some background reading for this week ... I updated the week 8 tab
in the organizer, but forgot to say anything here in the news,
sorry.

**Midterm Solution**

Solutions for the first two challenges on the midterm have been posted, together with a readme, in
the "midterm" content section on D2L.

The part 3 solution will follow "soon".

**Week 7 - Oct 16**  
Week 7 is midterm week, and ours is 8:30-10:30 Tues Oct **16**, in 581.
I arranged the time so I can be available in case of
questions. 

I have posted some midterm prep notes in the week 7 tab.

I have not had a chance to grade lab 4, sorry, nor to post a solution for it.
I am still working on that.

The midterm is to be found in the "Midterm"  content section of our D2L instance.
It will become available at 08:30, and the dropbox has a due date of 10:30.
I will be on our slack channel to answer any questions (in the general channel).

I have simplified things, with only three scripts to write for the exam.

Good luck!
