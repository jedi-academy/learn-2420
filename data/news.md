**Week 9** (Mon 11:00)
- The investigative reports have been investigated, and incorporated
into the organizer as the last wection ("week 16"), for your
reading pleasure.

**Week 8** (Mon 14:30)
- No required reading/survey this week - I don't know enough about what you
already know about networking concepts from 2620, and will be relying on
your guidance (wise or not). I suggest reviewing the 2620 network concepts,
as we will be working through Chapter 11 in the RHSA guide.

Course hub updates will be posted on https://acit3620.slack.com, which you
can join with a my.bcit.ca email address.
