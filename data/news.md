**Week 11**  
I have posted some prep notes/reading, and a survey.

Our work this week applies learnings from the student guide,
but is not directly based on it!

There will be a quiz this week, on logging (chapter 10).

**Week 10**  
This week's seminar (lab 7) is posted ... there is no specific prep
to do this week (enjoy the remaining hours of your spring break).

We will be working with Chapter 11, Managing Linux Networking.

There will be a quiz this week, on services and daemons (chapters 8/9).
