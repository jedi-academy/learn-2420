**Week 7 (midterm)**  
I bet you're happy to have the midterm behind you!  
A solution has been posted in the content/midterm section on D2L;
the files are named `zsetup.sh` and `zwork.sh`.

I have marked the midterms, and published the feedback on D2L.  
I started out posting comments about what was wrong with incorrect
answers, but that was taking waaaaaay too long, so I reverted to
choosing the appropriate part mark, as appropriate.

The class average was 37/60, and the median was 42/60.
Results ranged from a low of 0 to a high of 56.
Do take a look at your results, and I will answer questions about
the midterm next week in class.

-------------------

Reminder: I have tweaked the schedule and topics for the balance
of the course.
