**Week 3** (Sun 08:30)  
Reading & lab posted.

The D2L survey mechanism appears to be broken at the moment :(  
I have prepared a [worksheet](https://learn.bcit.ca/d2l/le/content/407483/viewContent/2603398/View) instead,
for you to complete and submit to a special purpose dropbox (the week 3 survey), before
9:30pm Monday evening. 

This survey is only to guage your perceptions about Linux after watching
the week 3 prep video, and to share these with the class.

I hope the D2L survey mechanism is fixed before we need to use it again!

**Week 2** (Mon 22:00)  
- posted introduction & first seminar

Course hub updates will be posted on https://acit3620.slack.com, which you
