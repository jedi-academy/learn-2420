The [course content survey](https://learn.bcit.ca//d2l/lms/survey/user/attempt/survey_start_frame.d2l?si=340874&ou=446835) I put together. 

**Assignment 3**  
I have agreed to extend the deadline for assignment 3, to Monday evening.
This will give you a chance to perform attacks on other teams' Pis during
lab. You will not have the whole lab for this, but hopefully an hour.
