- Tues 10:45-12:45 in DTC-581 (sets A & B) / 578 (set C)
- open book, open internet, just no "ask a friend"
- preparation: last term's midterm is on D2L, in the "Study Aids" content section
- content: you will be building a shell script, with multiple parts in it, each for
part of the midterm grade

### Week 6 - Feb 12/13

Prep: reading
Lab: File Permissions
See organizer tab below

**NOTE**: I am making a slight adjustment to the
course schedule, handling "file permissions" in class
rather than leaving it to your spare time.
Dealing with "processes" gets bumped to the week after our 
midterm, and this will also involve a lighter treatment of
"hardening Linux" at the end of the course.
