*Week 7 - Oct 17*  
Week 7 is midterm week, and ours is 8:30-10:30 Tues Oct **16**, in 581.
I arranged the time so I can be available in case of
questions. Details will be announced closer to the exam.

**Week 6 - Oct 9/10**  
This week, we will be experimenting with D2L's virtual classroom to run our seminars.

I will fire up two sessions for each seminar (since they can only last 90 minutes).
I would like to see one student from each pod login to the virtual classroom,
and they can share their screen on the pod's large monitor. Students in the same pod
can then ask questions using the logged in station.

I don't trust that there is enough bandwidth for everyone to login at the same
time, so we shall see how this works.

I am going to hold the seminar in two parts - one on file permissions and
one on processes. This is based on feedback from last term, where there
were misunderstandings about permissions and how they work.

**Week 5 - Oct 2/3**  
Pi time. See tab below.

Survey results posted, below.

**Week 4 - Sept 25/26**  
Prep for this week: play with Vagrant ... see the organizer tab below :)

Seminar posted :)

**Week 3 - Sept 18/19**  
Prep for this week: work through Chapter 4 in the student guide.

The Weds group will indeed be in 581 :)

**Week 2 - Sept 11/12**  
You should have registered for the Red Hat Academy, and gotten access
to the SysAdmin I Student Guide. 
You should also have VirtualBox installed, with a CentOS VM.  
If either of these if not the case, see me at the beginning of class!

There might be a room change - check your timetable before class!

**Welcome to ACIT2420**

Welcome to ACIT2420, Linux System Administration :)

Our first session will be Weds Sept 5th.
The ACIT2520 and 2420 seminars will be split in two, so that Michal
and I can introduce our courses to both sets.
