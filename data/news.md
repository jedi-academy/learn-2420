**Week 9** 
This week's seminar (lab 6) is posted, and there is an optional survey
if you have questions for me to address at the beginning of class next week.

Yes, there will be a quiz next week ... the rumours are true!
It will be a "fun quiz" (i.e. not counting for marks, so you can see
the style) on the topic of "processes".  
There will be three real quizzes after spring break, 
**Week 8**  
This week's seminar (Lab 5) posted.

Note: part of the lab talks about filtering TCP ports ... that info is not in the `systemctl` output.
You can use the `netstat -a` conmmand to see the ports used :-/

**Updated the PiGUI notes!**

**CentOS on your Pi**  
Added a bit of a writeup in the "week 6" organizer tab
addressing a GUI on CentOS on the Pi.

If you can't get it working, then switch to a Pi activity, that you haven't done previously,
and which can be completed from the command line.\
If this is the case, explain your activity switch in your assignment
writeup.
