**Week 10**  
This week's seminar (lab 7) will be posted before class ... there is no specific prep
to do this week (enjoy the remaining hours of your spring break).

We will be working with Chapter 11, Managing Linux Networking.

There will be a quiz this week, on services and daemons (chapters 8/9).
