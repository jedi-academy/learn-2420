Fixed the week numbering, so that week 5 contains lesson 5 & lab 5 etc

**Week 5** (Tue 10:10)  
- You may find that the "ifconfig" command is not present in your server VM.
You can either "yum install net-tools" to install it, or use the
alternate command "ip addr"
- Lab 5 posted
- Reading for the week posted. 
- No survey this week :)
- Quiz this week instead :(


Course hub updates will be posted on https://acit3620.slack.com, which you
