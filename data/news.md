**Virtual classroom experiment - Weds Oct 10**

Yesterday's experiment was not the most successful :(
We learned lots, but the firewall, platform support,
and bandwidth issues crippled the session.
One artifact from the session is a pair of
slack channels inside our umbrella ACIT2420 one,
addressing file permissions and processes,
respectively.

For today, I have setup an account with [Zoom](https://zoom.us),
and we will give that a go.

Shortly before 11:30, I will post an invite on D2L.
I haven't used Zoom before, but I suspect you
will need to download a player for your system.



**Virtual classroom experiment - Tues Oct 9**

At 8:30, I will fire up a virtual classroom on D2L for us.

I don't know how well it will work - that is part of the experiment!
I will be "broadcasting" from my temporary apartment here in Dongguan,
and it has sporadically excellent bandwidth (it sometimes drops off for
a few minutes). 

I don't know which A/V settings will work best, for me or for you.
I have headphones with a mic, but only a headphone jack on my laptop,
so am planning to use the built-in webcam and microphone.

If the VC doesn't go well, I will switch over to Windows,
and try a VPN connection from this end.

We may have to do some chatting on slack :-/

Thank you for your patience, and I shall see you shortly in the VC :)
*Week 7 - Oct 17*  
Week 7 is midterm week, and ours is 8:30-10:30 Tues Oct **16**, in 581.
I arranged the time so I can be available in case of
questions. Details will be announced closer to the exam.

**Week 6 - Oct 9/10**  
This week, we will be experimenting with D2L's virtual classroom to run our seminars.

I will fire up two sessions for each seminar (since they can only last 90 minutes).
I would like to see one student from each pod login to the virtual classroom,
and they can share their screen on the pod's large monitor. Students in the same pod
can then ask questions using the logged in station.

I don't trust that there is enough bandwidth for everyone to login at the same
time, so we shall see how this works.

I am going to hold the seminar in two parts - one on file permissions and
one on processes. This is based on feedback from last term, where there
were misunderstandings about permissions and how they work.

**Week 5 - Oct 2/3**  
Pi time. See tab below.

Survey results posted, below.

**Week 4 - Sept 25/26**  
Prep for this week: play with Vagrant ... see the organizer tab below :)

Seminar posted :)

**Week 3 - Sept 18/19**  
Prep for this week: work through Chapter 4 in the student guide.

The Weds group will indeed be in 581 :)

**Week 2 - Sept 11/12**  
You should have registered for the Red Hat Academy, and gotten access
to the SysAdmin I Student Guide. 
You should also have VirtualBox installed, with a CentOS VM.  
If either of these if not the case, see me at the beginning of class!

There might be a room change - check your timetable before class!

**Welcome to ACIT2420**

Welcome to ACIT2420, Linux System Administration :)

Our first session will be Weds Sept 5th.
The ACIT2520 and 2420 seminars will be split in two, so that Michal
and I can introduce our courses to both sets.
