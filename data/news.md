**Week 7 - Oct 16**  
Week 7 is midterm week, and ours is 8:30-10:30 Tues Oct **16**, in 581.
I arranged the time so I can be available in case of
questions. 

I have posted some midterm prep notes in the week 7 tab.

**Week 6 - Oct 9/10**  
We came, we tried to see, and learned some useful remote classroom lessons,
thank you. I wasn't very impressed with D2L's Virtual Classroom;
Zoom worked much better, even though using a VPN.
The experiments will continue, but with other courses, in week 7.

I am going to hold the week 6 seminar in two parts - one on file permissions and
one on processes. This is based on feedback from last term, where there
were misunderstandings about permissions and how they work.

**Week 5 - Oct 2/3**  
Pi time. See tab below.

Survey results posted, below.

**Week 4 - Sept 25/26**  
Prep for this week: play with Vagrant ... see the organizer tab below :)

Seminar posted :)

**Week 3 - Sept 18/19**  
Prep for this week: work through Chapter 4 in the student guide.

The Weds group will indeed be in 581 :)

**Week 2 - Sept 11/12**  
You should have registered for the Red Hat Academy, and gotten access
to the SysAdmin I Student Guide. 
You should also have VirtualBox installed, with a CentOS VM.  
If either of these if not the case, see me at the beginning of class!

There might be a room change - check your timetable before class!

**Welcome to ACIT2420**

Welcome to ACIT2420, Linux System Administration :)

Our first session will be Weds Sept 5th.
The ACIT2520 and 2420 seminars will be split in two, so that Michal
and I can introduce our courses to both sets.
