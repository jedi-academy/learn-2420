## Course description
The objective of this course is to teach students basic Network Operating System administration tasks using
Linux. At the end of the course the students should be able to install and configure a Linux-based network.
Configuration tasks include installing the software, adding hardware, networking the servers, managing users,
monitoring performance, scripting and troubleshooting. Students are also expected to configure common server
services such as DNS, NHCP, Apache and IP Tables.


## Course goals
BCIT is a Red Hat Academic Partner, and we will be following their System Administration I course.

Students will have access to some of Red Hat's certification courses: System Administration I (RH124) as part of
this course, and System Administration II (RH134), on completion of this course, through the Red Hat Academy.
These equip the student to take the Red Hat Certified System Administrator Exam (EX200).


## Course learning outcomes / competencies
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:  
- Access the command line.
- Manage files from the command line.
- Access help & documentation.
- Create, view, and edit text files.
- Manage local users and groups.
- Control access to files.
- Monitor and manage processes.
- Control services and daemons
- Configure and secure OpenSSH service.
- Analyze and store system logs.
- Manage networking.
- Archive and copy files between systems.
- Install and update software packages.
- Access Linux file systems.

## Learning resources
- Red Hat academy: [Red Hat System Administration I](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/rh124-red-hat-system-administration-i
) (RH124). Students will need to register online with
Gilmore Global’s [Red Hat Academy learning portal](https://rhlearn.gilmore.ca), to gain access to the student guide.  
Alternately, or additionally, Red Hat's [System Administrator's Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System_Administrators_Guide/index.html) will be a valuable reference.
- Students will need to install several [CentOS 7](https://centos.org) instances, in [virtualized containers](virtualbox.org) 
and/or using a [virtual machine](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html), to perform lab exercises.
- Students will need to purchase a Raspberry Pi starter kit (about $100), possibly split with a partner, to complete the assignments.

## Other information
This course builds on Red Hat Inc's System Administration I course, which has an online student guide available
to our students, but only after registration on the Red Hat Academy Learning Portal, a cloud-based service
which requires real name & address data for registration. Per institute policy, there is a learner consent form for
this in the content area of the D2L instance for this course. The course hub will include links to alternate
resources, for those students who do not wish to use this external service. This will be addressed in the opening
session.

## Course specific requirements

The expected workload for this course is one hour out-of-class for each timetabled hour.
The expectation is that a student will spend one hour on the assigned reading and
related quiz/questionnaire, and two hours practicing or collaborating on assignment(s).

Weekly readings will be assigned, starting with the second week, following a
flipped learning model. Students are to read these lessons and answer a
survey/quiz/questionnaire, by the evening before that week's lecture.
A lecturette, at the beginning of each seminar, will address unclear topics, per the students' responses,
and discuss industry issues relevant to that week's topics.

Most labs are individual, while some will use pair programming.

Assignments will be completed in student-selected project teams of 2-3 members, using Raspberry Pi computer
kits.
The same team will be used for all assignments. If a student does not have a team,
they will be assigned one by the instructor.
Team members' grades are commensurate with their contribution, as well as
performance assessed by an assignment rubric.

Course materials (lessons, examples, tutorials, labs and assignments) will be
shared through a public website (the course “hub”), with sensitive material (including Red Hat proprietary
guides) on D2L.

Lab and assignment feedback will be provided through the D2L dropboxes that
readme files are submitted to. The D2L gradebook will be useful only to review
D2L-captured grade components, and it will not provide an accurate final grade in the course.

Students who miss class for an acceptable reason will be excused from attendance
and survey/quiz/questionnaire completion, should those fall during the excused
period. Missed readings or lab work will need to be made up by the student
