#Seminar #7 Our Midterm
ACIT2420 - BCIT - Fall 2018

Our midterm will have you create & submit four small shell scripts. 
They will cover managing files, scripting, managing users and managing permissions;
in other words, material from labs 2-4 and 6a (no processes on the midterm).

Each script will be graded on completeness, correctness, conciseness and readability.
Solutions will be posted later on Tuesday.

The midterm will be open book, including internet. You may search (if you can afford the time),
but no "asking a friend". Other than me, of course - I will be on the main slack
channel for the course, to address questions about the midterm.

Starter scripts, with comments, will be provided, similar to last term.

What to review? the student guide (Chapters  2-6) and the bash and sed primers.

Useful examples?
