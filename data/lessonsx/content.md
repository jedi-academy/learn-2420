#Course Content Survey Results
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Winter 2018

Thank you for taking part in the course content survey (the 20% who did).

My takeaways from the results are shown in alert boxes below each question.

###Biggest problems you had with this course?

- Quizzes and tests were much much harder than the practice material
- There is a lot of memorization required, especially file paths and the location of config files
- Lakc of time
- Explanation of some points and support during the labs
- Preparation bafore midterm for the bash script
- Midterm format
- Course content
- Partner set up with Pi related activities
- All conceptual sections were painful. Course should be entirely Practical
- need more class time for final assignment
- there wasnt much visual aid to help me see what things do
- we didnt get enough teaching in class
- relied too much on redhat

<div class="alert alert-info">
    Need more instruction & practice, especially for scripting
</div>

###Types of online activity, preceding a lab/seminar, are?

<div class="alert alert-info">
    Assigned readings, especially from the student guide, help.
</div>

###Techniques for assessing online activity part of "blended"?

<img src="/pix/lessons/content-survey2.png"/>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    D2L survey or quiz, for some small marks, sound appropriate.
</div>

###Effectiveness of different ways to start a seminar with a "mini-lecture"?

<img src="/pix/lessons/content-survey3.png"/>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    Recap of the important concepts and main points of the Student Guide chapter(s).
</div>


###Effectiveness of different lab styles/techniques?

<img src="/pix/lessons/content-survey4.png"/>
<img src="/pix/lessons/content-survey5.png"/>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    Current practices work, but no individual tool assessments.
</div>


###Opinions about the Raspberry Pi (for assignments)?

<img src="/pix/lessons/content-survey6.png"/>
<img src="/pix/lessons/content-survey7.png"/>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    Continue with entry level Pi, introduced earlier.
    Start with RaspbianOS and graduate to CentOS.
</div>

###Opinions about the hands-on midterm?

<img src="/pix/lessons/content-survey8.png"/>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    Hands-on, with shell script, but introduce shell scripting in lab.
</div>

###Topics on the RHCSA from the followup course to ours ... should these be addressed in our course?

<img src="/pix/lessons/content-survey9.png"/>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    All three topics sound appropriate to address, especially security & troubleshooting.
</div>

###Topics not addressed in the RHCSA curriculum ... should these be part of ACIT3620?

<img src="/pix/lessons/content-survey10.png"/>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    Shell scripting and "hacking" belong, but not so much OS theory.
</div>

###Topics that you feel should be addressed or emphasized much more, in ACIT3620?

- Process management (kill process etc) is difficult, I would have liked to spend more time on that.
- More shell scripting to complete tasks. This is good practice for using multiple commands
- More project oriented assignment that make use of multiple tools
- The proccess of the hardening the Pi and teacher to show and explain this topic on the lesson
- Same with hacking - show and explain on the lesson the hacking part of the course
- Explaining the background process of the hacking and hack-tools
- Pi activity
- Security
- Learning that linux can be normal for computer usage
- Security
- Drive Management/Partitioning
- Process Management
- bash scripting
- basic linux commands
- bash scripting

<div class="alert alert-info">
    Gotta have bash scripting, and need to address security.
</div>

###What are three topics that should that not be addressed in the course, or which should be downplayed?tt

- All these topics are important to sys admin work, I would still try and cover everything.
- If it is not enough time (like in this term) probably hacking and securing should be downsized, but explainned more explicitly
- file system
- I can't think of any, but don't add a tonne of theory
- the pi not a fan of it
- hacking the pi
