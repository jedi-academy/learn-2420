#Seminar #9 File &amp; Virtualized Systems
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Fall 2017

No specific prep for this week - we are going to work through Chapters
14 (Accessing Linux File Systems) and 
15 (Using Virtualized Systems).

These are the last two sections in Red Hat System Administration I.

##In a nutshell...

These last two sections aren't hard, and you should have no problems in class.

The big deal with Chapter 12 is understanding the **mount/umount**, **ln** and **find/locate** commands:

The big deal with Chapter 13 is understanding **KVM**, but that won't work in our environment.
We're going to dive into Pixel instead.

##How about that quiz?

I hope to have a quiz ready for you for tomorrow, based on sections 12 & 13 (last week's topics).
