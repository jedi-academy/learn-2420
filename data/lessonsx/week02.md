#Seminar #2 Survey Results
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Winter 2018

Here are the questions the class had about "The Cathedral and the Bazaar".
Some of these have answers below the question, while the others will be addressed in class.

- How would a leader/coordinator handle abandoned portions of the open-source project?  
_Spin them off into separate repositories, with a suitable tag and/or readme. **Yack**_
- Building on the question above, how would a leader/coordinator get developers to work on parts of the project that are left alone because no one wants to work on it for some reason?  
_Motivating contributors is part of the job of the project lead. If not possible, consider abandoning the parts no one wants to work on._
- Is code refactoring ever needed for open source software with a vast amount of developers? If it is, how is it made possible due to the frequent updates and releases? Especially when there are so many developers and everyone writes code in different styles  
_Absolutely. Flag small refactorings as suitable for new contributors.  Publish & enforce style / refactoring / conduct guidelines to prevent collisions. **Yack**_
- "closed-source world cannot win an evolutionary arms race with open-source communities that can put orders of magnitude more skilled time into a problem" (pg25) If a large project has been closed-sourced for a long time, can it all of a sudden be open sourced? What kind of difficulty will it experience?  
_Yes, but you need to be careful that proprietary code doesn't find its way into the open source code.
You need to be extremely careful with souce code licensing! **Yack**_
- Has there ever been a project that used a combination of cathedral and bazaar methods successfully?  
_Sun Microsystems & Oracle have both flirted with this, with varying degrees of success. Egs ZFS, Java, some distros.  **Yack**_
- Will we have to have a thorough understanding of SMTP for this course?  
_Not sure where SMTP comes from ... isn't that an email protocol?
- (When is a rose not a rose??)  
_It may look like a rose (pretty software), but it won't smell like one if the data structures stink._
- will this essay be tested/quized on  
_The essay - not per se; the major lessons - well, they are essential to the Linux culture, right?  **Yack**_
- in an open-source project, are testers and contributers basically free labour?  
_Someone pays many of the contributors, directly or indirectly. People contributing during their spare time really
are providing free labor, but you will find yourself "lynched" if you assume free labor._
- What are other examples of well-known software that have utilized the bazaar method effectively?  
_NetBeans, Eclipse, github, Twitter, many parts of Google (product and company), Mozilla, PHP  **Yack**_
- Are there any major companies that use or have used the bazaar method for their projects?  
_Even Microsoft is jumping on the bandwagon, though for select projects only (Powershell, Visual Studio Code)_
- Is there ever a case when you open source something that no one is interested in debugging it?  
_Yup. See first two questions_
- Can you switch between Cathedral development and Bazaar development?  
_With great difficulty. Sun/Oracle with Solaris, Java, MySQL, OpenOffice **Yack**_
- Why would you want to?  
_Free labor?_
- Since open-source software development relies on "co-developers", how would you motivate your users to contribute to the project when they would have to do it out of interest?  
_Make it fun, give credit, emulate Google **Yack**_
- How would you choose which contributions to integrate into your software when there can be thousands of them at a time?  
_Peer review & discussion on github, hierarchical "management (general & lieutenants) **Yack**_
- I have a question I am not sure if you can answer, but why did Linux never become as major as the other operatiing systems  
_Considered a toy for years, still considered "unfriendly" compared to desktop alternatives.  
On the server, Unix ruled for many years - it was much more powerful and reliable than Linux (the poor cousin), though
Linux has pretty much caught up._
- Linux seems to have the Mac system entirely beat other than the fact that mac has a much larger support and testing network, yet it seems to make more sense to use Linux  
_Linux makes total sense server-side, with no GUI.  
Linux makes sense if you want the same environment for development, testing & deployment.  
Mac has Apple behind it, with wonderful support & marketing._
- how heavy are we going to focus on unix this term?  
_Only so far as Linux emulates it. There are times it is important to now the root/origin of things.  **Yack**_
- Why do close-source development not try to adopt similar approach of open-soruce development. But just do it in a more/small sphere since they cannot afford to "hire" everyone  
_They absolutely do. Essential modern software skill! Collaborative workflow!!_
- If there was no close-source development, wouldn't the issue of money and being able to keep developing open-soruce free stuff become a problem. I think that a lot of people who participate in open source probably work day jobs, and do it as volunteers in after hours since like the essay says, they will be working on something they care/like more than they do when they go regular 9-5  
_Gotta love motivated volunteers :D Even with no money, many share stuff to "improve the world"._
- What is preventing open-soruce development from flipping the switch and become closed/selling it off after everyone contributed to make the product/tool what it is. Only one or few people make money and rest get screwed out, is there a reason this doesn't happen more often? What stopped the author from selling his tool to some other service and "cashing" out  
_Licensing!  **Yack**_
- if we were to design software should we use the cathedral or the bazaar model  
_Yes **Yack**_
- Can the lessons presented here be applicable to other IT aspects  
_Yes, eg stackoverflow **Yack**_
- for point 2, wouldn't reusing the code of other people cause issues?  
_Yup. See licensing comments earlier **Yack**_
- can you go over the 19 lessons in class, it was a bit hard to follow  
_No. I will point out the most important, though. **Yack**_
