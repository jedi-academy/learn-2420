#Upcoming Seminar Planning
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Fall 2017

This is not a lesson, but rather an explanation of the three paths
open to us for the three weeks before final exams. After reading these,
speak up on the "futures" survey that this item is associated with in 
the organizer, by midnight Weds Nov 8.

I will share the results, consider your input, and reach a decision for Thurs Nov 9.

##Path 1: 3 assignments

Following this path, each of the three weeks will involve progressively
more comprehensive assignments, applying the course material so far.
These are individual assignments, and I will be in class and available online to help you.

##Path 2: Raspberry Pi

This path would be similar to the first, except that the work would be done
using [Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org/) or Centos 7 on a Raspberry Pi.

This would be done in pairs, with weekly assignments suited to the platform.

###Path 2A: buy a Raspberry Pi

Between you, purchase a [Raspberry Pi 3 B kit](https://www.buyapi.ca/product-category/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-raspberry-pi-kits/),
like the [$90 media centre kit](https://www.buyapi.ca/product/raspberry-pi-3-media-center-kit-basic/)
or the [$100 ultimate kit](https://www.buyapi.ca/product/raspberry-pi-3b-ultimate-kit/).
Some of you may have a Pi already, which is fine. There are others too, but more expensive.

You would be responsible for purchasing the kit, and you would own the Pi once we are done with it.
If you buy it as a team, you have to figure out who keeps it, or which
line to cut it in half along.

Consider this path as using Raspbian OS.

###Path 2B: CentOS on a Pi

This is the same as path 2A, except that we would install and work with CentOS 7
on the Pi.

###Path 2C: Emulate a Raspberry Pi

There is a [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rpiqemuwindows/) project to emulate a Pi on Windows 10.
Yes, this would be running a Pi inside a virtualized environment. Slower and clunkier, but
you don't have to put out for the kit itself. There are a [tutorial](http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Emulator-for-Windows-10/)
and a [how to](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/emulate-raspberry-pi-pc/) 
article that you might want to check out before going down this path.

I don't know how well this would work, or if it would even address everything we want to do.

##Path 3: System Administration II

This path involves pursuing some of the material from the followup course to
*System Administration I*. You have free online access to the student guide for this,
and its style is similar to the student guide we are using now.

Topics that could be reasonably addressed in the three weeks:
- week1: installation with Kickstart, scheduling future tasks, and using ACLs
- week2: managing SELinux Security and using identity management services
- week3: controlling and troubleshooting the boot process, and configuring the firewall
