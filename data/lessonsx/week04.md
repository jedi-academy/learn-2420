#Seminar #4 Survey Results
ACIT3620 - BCIT - Fall 2017

The survey results are in. 15 of the class responded, and it is apparent
that some took the survey less seriously than others :-/

the original question: 
_I want to build a word map of the adjectives that apply to processes. Provide below the top three "single word" adjectives that would apply to the word "process" to characterize them._

I "normalized" the rest of the results, and made a word map for the similarities
and for the differences. Check them out below :)

The answers:

- instance	4
- multitasking	3
- instructions	2
- logical	2
- program	2
- running	2
- states	2
- task	2
- communication	
- Daemon	
- dependent	
- dificult	
- efficient	
- Executable	
- executing	
- execution	
- frustrating	
- fundamental	
- goal	
- important	
- journey	
- Kernal	
- maddening	
- material
