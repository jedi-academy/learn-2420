#Seminar #2 Online Prep
ACIT2420 - BCIT - Fall 2018

The student guide has an introduction to Linux, but it can be a bit dry. 
We will be going through the first two
chapters in class this week, but I would like you to watch a 1 hour video 
from Grant McWilliams, 
[Linux: Overview and Installation](https://www.lynda.com/Linux-tutorials/Linux-Overview-Installation/514199-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a18%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3acentos+7%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2),
before our class this week.

You can access this through the BCIT library online - you are entitled to a lynda.com account without having to pay for it :)

I am not sure if the link above will work properly ... this is the first time
I am using the service. Bear with us :-/
