# Elastic Logstash

## Description

Logstash is a web-based pipeline application that accepts input from a “multitude of sources” at the same time and stores the information on a server.

## Origin

“Founded in 2012 in Amsterdam by the people behind Elasticsearch and Apache Lucene, Elastic set forth a vision that search can solve a plethora of data problems. The origins of the company start back in 2010, when Shay Banon wrote the first lines of Elasticsearch and open sourced it as a distributed search engine. With the rise of cloud computing and changes in IT infrastructure demanding requirements such as real-time search across infinite amounts of structured and unstructured data, Shay foresaw the need for a new type of software to solve today's real-world data problems. Steven Schuurman, Uri Boness, and Simon Willnauer shared in Shay's vision, joining forces to create the Elastic company we have today. Since then, the creators of Kibana, Logstash, and Beats have joined the Elastic family, rounding out a product portfolio known as the Elastic Stack, which is used by millions of developers around the world. The Elastic family unites employees across 32 countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.” 

## Claim to fame

* It is a widely used application, and there aren’t a lot of alternatives that can handle the same function at the same capacity.
* It has a large variety of potential input sources that it can handle simultaneously, and has a multitude of outputs the data can go to depending on the situation.
* It can parse incoming data dynamically. 
* It has 200+ modular components (plugins) that you can use to customize to increase extensibility, durability, monitoring, and security.

## Our experience

Installation was pretty straightforward. You could install it by downloading the rpm and installing it or through the terminal. We feel like it has potential but definitely not for newbies. It has an online documentation that is well structured and very informative. If we had more time, we could probably do more with it.

One thing that we noticed is that it takes time to load when we start it up.

## Evaluation
### Ease of installation: 4
Installation is pretty straight forward.

### Documentation: 4
Online documentation is well structured and has lots of information

### Ease of use: 2
We feel like its not for newbies

### Overhead: 3
We noticed some delay when starting the program. And it also runs in JVM which adds to overhead

### Quality of results: 2
Can't really measure this one as we haven't really got it do real analysis

### Recommendation
Depends on if you can make it work or not. It seems to have a lot of potential, but it is extremely particular in terms of setup and use.
