#Seminar #7 - Managing Networking
ACIT2420 - BCIT - Fall 2018

##Overview

You have learned lots about networking concepts and configuration in ACIT2620.
This seminar is meant to complement that, by managing network connections
from the command line, using **nmcli**.

For prep, I suggest you skim the first two sections in Chapter 11: network concepts, and
validating network configuration.

The student guide refers to IP addresses in the 172.25.x.x range.
That is how the Red Hat classroom server would be setup, while
our addresses are assigned in a 142.232.x.x range in lab.
Adjust commands and examples accordingly.

**CAUTION**: the lab writeup in the student guide has you reboot part way through.
You need to save your terminal history in a test file **before** rebooting,
and append to it after rebooting. If you don't, you run the tisk of having to 
repeat part of the lab :'(

##Lab parts, per the student guide

We will be concentrating on the third chapter, "Configuring networking with nmcli".

Remember what you learned in 2620, and in previous work in this course!

##Lab Teams?

This is an individual lab.

##Lab Submission

**CAUTION**: the lab writeup in the student guide has you reboot part way through.

and append to it after rebooting. If you don't, you run the tisk of having to 
repeat part of the lab :'(

Complete the guided exercise in section 11.6, after reading section 11.5,
"Configuring networking with nmcli". Save your log or a screenshot of the last portion of
it for submission.

Complete the "lab", section 11.11 in the student guide, again with a log
or screenshot(s).

When you complete the 11.11 lab steps, adjust the IP
address range as appropriate.

We don't have the `lab network grade` script, so we will fake it:
- display your network configuration
- display the contents of your hosts file

Save the contents of the terminal window in a text file, and submit it to
the lab07 dropbox.
